    "statement": "Given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ and an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.\nWe call the permutation $$$p$$$\ngenerating\nfor the array $$$a$$$ if the array $$$a$$$ can be obtained from the permutation $$$p$$$ by applying some number of operations (possibly zero) of the following type:\nChoose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i  \\lt  n$$$) and perform one of two replacements:\n$$$p_{i} := p_{i + 1}$$$;\n$$$p_{i + 1} := p_{i}$$$.\nIn other words, in one operation, you can choose two adjacent elements of the array and copy the value of one into the other.\nYou are required to report whether the permutation $$$p$$$ is\ngenerating\nfor the array $$$a$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the length of the array and the permutation.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_{i} \\le n$$$) — the elements of the permutation.\nThe third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i} \\le n$$$) — the elements of the array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output \"\nYES\n\" if the permutation $$$p$$$ is\ngenerating\nfor the array $$$a$$$, otherwise output \"\nNO\n\".\nYou may output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"\nyEs\n\", \"\nyes\n\", \"\nYes\n\", and \"\nYES\n\" will be accepted as a positive answer.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the array is generated from the permutation using one operation:\n$$$i = 2$$$ and $$$p_{i + 1} := p_{i}$$$.\nIn the second test case, it is impossible to obtain $$$a$$$ from $$$p$$$.\nIn the third test case, it is necessary to perform $$$2$$$ operations:\n$$$i = 1$$$ and $$$p_{i} := p_{i + 1}$$$;\n$$$i = 2$$$ and $$$p_{i + 1} := p_{i}$$$.",
