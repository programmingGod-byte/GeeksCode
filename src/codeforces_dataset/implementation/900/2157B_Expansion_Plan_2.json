    "title": "B. Expansion Plan 2",
    "statement": "ak+q - over the crimson skies\n⠀\nYou are analyzing an infinite grid with coordinates $$$(X, Y)$$$ (specifically, the cell immediately above $$$(0, 0)$$$ is $$$(0, 1)$$$, and the cell immediately on the right of $$$(0, 0)$$$ is $$$(1, 0)$$$). Initially, only the cell at $$$(0, 0)$$$ is black.\nYou are given a string $$$a_1a_2 \\ldots a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{\"4\"}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{\"8\"}$$$, which describes $$$n$$$ expansion operations. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the following happens for all cells simultaneously:\nif $$$s_i = \\texttt{\"4\"}$$$: for each cell, if it is orthogonally adjacent to a black cell (i.e., it shares a side), it becomes black; otherwise, its state remains the same;\nif $$$s_i = \\texttt{\"8\"}$$$: for each cell, if it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a black cell (i.e, it shares a side or a corner), it becomes black; otherwise, its state remains the same.\nIs the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ black at the end of the process?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5, -10^9 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$) — the number of expansion operations, and the $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ coordinates of the cell you are interested in, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{\"4\"}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{\"8\"}$$$ — the types of expansion operations.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$ if the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ is black after the expansion operations described by the string $$$s$$$, and $$$\\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise.\nThe judge is case-insensitive (for example, $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$, $$$\\texttt{Yes}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yes}$$$, $$$\\texttt{yEs}$$$ will all be recognized as positive answers).",
    "note": "Note\nThe first three test cases are illustrated below:\nIn the first test case, after the expansion operations in the string $$$\\texttt{\"888\"}$$$, cell $$$(3, 3)$$$ is black, so the answer is $$$\\texttt{YES}$$$.\nIn the second test case, cell $$$(5, 1)$$$ is white after the expansion operations in the string $$$\\texttt{\"4884\"}$$$.",
