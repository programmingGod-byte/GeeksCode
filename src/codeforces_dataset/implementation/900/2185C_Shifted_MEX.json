    "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You are allowed to perform the following operation once.\nSelect an integer $$$x$$$ (which may be negative), and for each value $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$$$, set $$$a_i = a_i + x$$$.\nFor example, if $$$a = [1, 3, 4, 2]$$$, and you perform the operation with $$$x = 3$$$, $$$a$$$ is now equal to $$$[4, 6, 7, 5]$$$.\nOutput the maximum possible value of $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ after the operation is performed.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([1, 2, 0, 5])$$$ is $$$3$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([1, 2, 4, 9])$$$ is $$$0$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3000$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3000$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible value of $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$ after the operation has been performed.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, performing the operation with $$$x = -4$$$ makes $$$a = [0]$$$, and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([0]) = 1$$$.\nFor the second test case, the $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ is already $$$4$$$, which is the highest possible, so we can perform the operation with $$$x = 0$$$, which will not change the array.",
