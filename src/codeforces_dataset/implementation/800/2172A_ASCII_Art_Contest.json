    "statement": "Three leading AI-powered creative assistants—Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude—enter the first ever ASCII Art Contest, where they must impress a panel of human judges with their text-based masterpieces.\nEach participant receives a score between 80 and 100 (inclusive). The organizers want to announce the final standing only if the judges' opinions are \"close enough\"; otherwise, they will ask the judges to reconsider.\nGiven the three integer scores of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude, determine the contest result:\nIf the maximum score and the minimum score differ by at least 10 points, print\ncheck again\n(the judging seems inconsistent, so the panel must re-evaluate).\nOtherwise, print\nfinal X\n, where\nX\nis the median of the three scores (the score that would be in the middle if all three were sorted in non-decreasing order).",
