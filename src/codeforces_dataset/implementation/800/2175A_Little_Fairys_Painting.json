    "statement": "The little fairy has a ribbon with $$$10^{18}$$$ cells and an infinite variety of colors. The first $$$n$$$ cells of the ribbon have already been colored, where the $$$i$$$-th cell is colored with color $$$a_i$$$.\nLittle fairy will color the remaining cells in order from $$$n+1$$$ to $$$10^{18}$$$. For the $$$i$$$-th cell:\nLittle fairy first counts the number of distinct colors currently present on the ribbon, denoted as $$$c_i$$$.\nThen she will color the $$$i$$$-th cell with color $$$c_i$$$.\nWhat color will the fairy use for the $$$10^{18}$$$-th cell?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the number of colored cells.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^3$$$) — the colors of the cells.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print the color of the last cell.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, each time there is only one distinct color on the ribbon, so the fairy always chooses the color $$$1$$$.\nIn the second example, the fairy will color the next $$$1000$$$ cells with colors from $$$1$$$ to $$$1000$$$ sequentially, after that all next cells will be colored with color $$$1000$$$.",
