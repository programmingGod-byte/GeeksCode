    "statement": "You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Construct a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ satisfying the following condition:\n$$$\\lvert p_i - p_{i+1} \\rvert$$$ is divisible by $$$i$$$ for every $$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$.\nIt can be proven that such a permutation always exists under the constraints of the problem.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$ to be constructed.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$-s are distinct) — the permutation you constructed.\nIf there are multiple valid permutations, you may output any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, $$$p=[1,2]$$$ satisfies the condition because $$$\\lvert p_1-p_2\\rvert=\\lvert 1-2\\rvert=1$$$, which is divisible by $$$1$$$.\nIn the second test case, $$$p=[2,3,1]$$$ satisfies the condition because:\n$$$\\lvert p_1-p_2\\rvert=\\lvert 2-3\\rvert=1$$$, which is divisible by $$$1$$$, and\n$$$\\lvert p_2-p_3\\rvert=\\lvert 3-1\\rvert=2$$$, which is divisible by $$$2$$$.",
