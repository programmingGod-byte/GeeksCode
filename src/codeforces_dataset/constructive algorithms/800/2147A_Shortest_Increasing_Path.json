    "statement": "You are at $$$(0, 0)$$$ in a rectangular grid and want to go to $$$(x, y)$$$.\nIn order to do so, you are allowed to perform a sequence of steps.\nEach step consists of moving a positive integer amount of length in the positive direction of either the $$$x$$$ or the $$$y$$$ axis.\nThe first step must be along the $$$x$$$ axis, the second along the $$$y$$$ axis, the third along the $$$x$$$ axis, and so on. Formally, if we number steps from one in the order they are done, then odd-numbered steps must be along the $$$x$$$ axis and even-numbered steps must be along the $$$y$$$ axis.\nAdditionally, each step must have a length\nstrictly greater\nthan the length of the previous one.\nOutput the minimum number of steps needed to reach $$$(x, y)$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of steps to reach $$$(x, y)$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.",
    "note": "Note\nVisualizer link\nIn the second test case, you can move to $$$(5, 0)$$$ by moving $$$5$$$ along the $$$x$$$ axis and then to $$$(5, 6)$$$ by moving $$$6$$$ along the $$$y$$$ axis.\nIn the third test case, you can move to $$$(1, 0)$$$, then to $$$(1, 2)$$$, and finally to $$$(4, 2)$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, reaching $$$(1, 1)$$$ is impossible since after moving to $$$(1, 0)$$$ along the $$$x$$$ axis, you are forced to move at least $$$2$$$ along the $$$y$$$ axis.",
