    "statement": "We call an array $$$[b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m]$$$ of length $$$m$$$\npalindromic\nif the following condition holds:\n$$$b_i = b_{m-i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$\nIn other words, an array is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\nYou are given an array $$$[a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_n]$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers where $$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.\nYou are required to perform the following operation\nexactly\n$$$k$$$ times:\nchoose an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x \\le n$$$,\nappend $$$x$$$ to the end of the array $$$a$$$.\nYour goal is to perform these $$$k$$$ operations in such a way that the number of palindromic subarrays$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ in the resulting array is minimized.\nOutput the $$$k$$$ integers you chose for each operation, in the order they were appended.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5, 1 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all the test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print the $$$k$$$ integers chosen for the append operations, in the order they were appended, such that the total number of palindromic subarrays in the resulting array is minimized.\nIf there are multiple answers, you may output any one of them.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, if we append $$$2$$$ to the end of the array, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1, 3, 3, 4, 2]$$$. Now $$$a$$$ has only $$$6$$$ palindromic subarrays — $$$[1]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[2]$$$, $$$[3, 3]$$$.",
