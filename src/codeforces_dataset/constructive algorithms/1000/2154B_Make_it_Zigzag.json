    "statement": "An arbitrary array of integers $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is considered awesome if for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < m$$$):\nif $$$i$$$ is\nodd\nthen $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$ holds.\nif $$$i$$$ is\neven\nthen $$$b_i > b_{i + 1}$$$ holds.\nIn other words, the following inequality is true: $$$b_1 < b_2 > b_3 < b_4 \\ldots$$$\nYou are given an array of positive integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You may do either of the following operations any number of times, in any order:\noperation $$$1$$$: select an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and do: $$$a_i := \\max(a_1,\\ldots,a_i)$$$, that is, replace $$$a_i$$$ with the prefix max up to $$$i$$$.\noperation $$$2$$$: select an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and then decrease $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$.\nDetermine the minimum number of times you need to do operation $$$2$$$ to make $$$a$$$ awesome. Note that you do\nnot\nneed to minimise the number of times you perform operation $$$1$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each testcase, output the minimum cost to make $$$a$$$ awesome.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the array is already awesome so no operations need to be done.\nIn the second test case, $$$a$$$ can be made awesome as follows:\nuse operation $$$2$$$ and decrease $$$a_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. $$$[\\color{red}3, 3, 2, 1] \\rightarrow [\\color{red}2, 3, 2, 1]$$$.\nuse operation $$$1$$$ and change $$$a_4$$$ to $$$\\max(2, 3, 2, 1) = 3$$$. $$$[2, 3, 2, \\color{red}1] \\rightarrow [2, 3, 2, \\color{red}3]$$$.\n$$$[2, 3, 2, 3]$$$ is awesome as $$$2 < 3 > 2 < 3$$$. It can be proven that this is the minimum number of times operation $$$2$$$ needs to be performed.",
