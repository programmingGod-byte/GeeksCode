    "statement": "A tree is a connected graph without cycles.\nA tree is called\nbeautiful\nif the sum of the products of the vertex labels for all its edges is a\nperfect square\n.\nMore formally, let $$$E$$$ be the set of edges in the tree. The tree is called\nbeautiful\nif the value $$$$$$S = \\sum_{\\{u, v\\} \\in E} (u \\cdot v)$$$$$$ is a perfect square. That is, there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$S = x^2$$$.\nYou are given an integer $$$n$$$. Your task is to construct a beautiful tree having $$$n$$$ vertices or report that such a tree does not exist.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.\nEach testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all the testcases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each testcase, if there is no beautiful tree having $$$n$$$ vertices, print $$$-1$$$.\nOtherwise, print $$$n-1$$$ lines denoting the edges of a beautiful tree having $$$n$$$ vertices. Each line should contain two space-separated integers $$$u,v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u,v \\le n$$$) representing an edge.\nThe vertices can be printed in any order within an edge, and the edges can be printed in any order.",
    "note": "Note\nTest case 1:\nNo beautiful tree exists with $$$2$$$ vertices. Hence, print $$$-1$$$.\nTest case 2:\n$$$S = (2\\cdot3) + (1\\cdot3) = 9 = (3)^2$$$\nTest case 3:\n$$$S = (2\\cdot1) + (3\\cdot1) + (4\\cdot1) = 9 = (3)^2$$$",
