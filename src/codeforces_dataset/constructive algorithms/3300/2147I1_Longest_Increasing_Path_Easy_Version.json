    "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version the second test is $$$n=100\\,000$$$. Hacks are not allowed in this problem.\nLet's call an integer sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$\ndistance-convex\nif $$$|a_{i} - a_{i-1}| < |a_{i+1} - a_{i}|$$$ for every $$$1 < i < n$$$. In other words, if you jump through the points $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ on the number line in this order, each next jump is strictly longer than the previous one.\nYou are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Find a\ndistance-convex\nsequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that contains\nat most $$$m$$$ distinct values\n. In terms of the jump sequence, that would mean that you need to make $$$(n-1)$$$ jumps of increasing lengths while visiting at most $$$m$$$ distinct points. $$$-10^{18} \\le a_i \\le 10^{18}$$$ should hold for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nInput consists of two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ on a single line.\nThere are only 2 tests for this problem.\n$$$n = 8$$$, $$$m = 6$$$;\n$$$n = 100\\,000$$$, $$$m = 15\\,000$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that an answer exists for both tests.\nHacks are not allowed in this problem.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nPrint a distance-convex sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ that contains at most $$$m$$$ distinct values. $$$-10^{18} \\le a_i \\le 10^{18}$$$ should hold for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$.\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nThe sequence $$$[1, 1, 3, 6, 10, 3, 11, 1]$$$ has length $$$n=8$$$ and contains $$$5$$$ different values, which is less than or equal to $$$m=6$$$. The differences between consecutive values are $$$0,2,3,4,7,8,10$$$, a strictly increasing sequence.\n$$$[1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 1]$$$ would be another valid answer.",
