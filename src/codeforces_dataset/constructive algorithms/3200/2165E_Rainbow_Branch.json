    "statement": "Given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, you need to assign a color to each edge. Define the\ninconvenience\nof an assignment as the maximum number of colors on the path between any two vertices.\nYou need to assign\nexactly\n$$$k$$$ different colors (each color must appear at least once) to the edges while minimizing the\ninconvenience\nof the assignment.\nPlease calculate the minimum\ninconvenience\nfor all $$$k=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\le n\\le3\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of vertices.\nThe next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two positive integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\\le u_i,v_i\\le n$$$) — indicating that there is an edge between vertices $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the edges in the input form a tree.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\\cdot10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing $$$n-1$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer represents the minimum\ninconvenience\nfor $$$k=i$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, possible solutions for $$$k=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$$$ are as follows:",
