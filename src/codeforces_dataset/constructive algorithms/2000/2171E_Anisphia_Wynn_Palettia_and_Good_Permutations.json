    "statement": "I've always loved the word magic. It has a way of making people happy, of putting a smile on their faces.\n— Anisphia Wynn Palettia\nAnis and her new assistant Euphie are improving the Witch's Broom! Magicology requires great precision and care — in order to fly, the construction of the broom must have sufficiently few imperfections.\nFor an arbitrary array $$$a$$$ of length $$$m$$$, call an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\leq i\\leq m-2$$$)\nbad\nif $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_{i+1}$$$, and $$$a_{i+2}$$$ are all pairwise coprime. More formally, $$$i$$$ is a bad index if and only if $$$\\gcd(a_i, a_{i+1}) = \\gcd(a_i, a_{i+2}) = \\gcd(a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}) = 1$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Furthermore, call $$$a$$$\ngood\nif it has at most $$$6$$$ bad indices.\nYou are given an integer $$$n$$$. Construct a good permutation$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It can be shown that such a permutation always exists.\nNote that you do not have to minimize the number of bad indices.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the\ngreatest common divisor\nof $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array that contains every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once, in any order.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output on a single line $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$, an example of a good permutation of length $$$n$$$. If there are multiple good permutations, you may output any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nFor $$$n=9$$$, we have\n$$$i$$$\n$$$p_i$$$\n$$$p_{i+1}$$$\n$$$p_{i+2}$$$\n$$$\\gcd(p_i, p_{i+1})$$$\n$$$\\gcd(p_i, p_{i+2})$$$\n$$$\\gcd(p_{i+1}, p_{i+2})$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$5$$$\n$$$4$$$\n$$$8$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$4$$$\n$$$2$$$\n$$$4$$$\n$$$8$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$4$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$8$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$9$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$4$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$9$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$5$$$\n$$$9$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$6$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$6$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$6$$$\n$$$2$$$\n$$$3$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$2$$$\n$$$7$$$\n$$$6$$$\n$$$2$$$\n$$$7$$$\n$$$2$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$1$$$\nThe only bad index is $$$3$$$.
