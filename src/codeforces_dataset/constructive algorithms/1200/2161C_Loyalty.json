    "title": "C. Loyalty",
    "statement": "No Loyalty No Royalty (c)\nYou are a customer in a store and want to buy $$$n$$$ items. Each item $$$i$$$ has a price $$$a_i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq X$$$, where $$$X$$$ is a\nloyalty factor\n.\nYour\nloyalty level\nin the store is defined as $$$\\lfloor {S \\over X} \\rfloor$$$, where $$$S$$$ is the total cost of items purchased so far. Initially, $$$S = 0$$$.\nIf you buy an item with price $$$p$$$ and your loyalty level increases as a result of this purchase, you earn $$$p$$$ bonus points.\nYour task is to find the\nmaximum number of bonus points\nyou can earn by choosing an optimal order of purchase for the items.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) and $$$X$$$ ($$$1 \\leq X \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of items and the loyalty factor.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq X$$$) — the prices of the items.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output two lines.\nThe first line should contain a single integer — the maximum number of bonus points that can be earned.\nThe second line should contain $$$n$$$ integers — the prices of the items in an order of purchase that maximizes the number of bonus points.\nIf there are several orders that maximize the number of bonus points, you can output any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case:\nAfter buying the first item $$$S = 1$$$, loyalty level is 0;\nAfter buying the second item $$$S = 3$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$1$$$ and earns $$$2$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the third item $$$S = 5$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$2$$$ and earns $$$2$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the fourth item $$$S = 7$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$3$$$ and earns $$$2$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the fifth item $$$S = 9$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$4$$$ and earns $$$2$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the sixth item $$$S = 11$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$5$$$ and earns $$$2$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the seventh item $$$S = 12$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$6$$$ and earns $$$1$$$ bonus point;\nAfter buying the eighth item $$$S = 13$$$;\nAfter buying the ninth item $$$S = 14$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$7$$$ and earns $$$1$$$ bonus point;\nAfter buying the tenth item $$$S = 15$$$.\nOverall we got $$$12$$$ bonus points.\nIn the second test case:\nAfter buying the first four items $$$S = 8$$$, loyalty level is 0;\nAfter buying the last item $$$S = 13$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$1$$$ and earns $$$5$$$ bonus points.\nIn the third test case:\nAfter buying the first eight items $$$S = 20$$$, loyalty level is 0;\nAfter buying the ninth item $$$S = 30$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$1$$$ and earns $$$10$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the tenth item $$$S = 51$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$2$$$ and earns $$$21$$$ bonus points;\nAfter buying the eleventh item $$$S = 73$$$, this increases loyalty level to $$$3$$$ and earns $$$22$$$ bonus points.",
