    "title": "B. The Curse of the Frog",
    "statement": "On an infinite number line, at point $$$0$$$, sits a frog. After many years of meditation, the frog has mastered $$$n$$$ unique types of magical jumps. The $$$i$$$-th type of jump allows it to jump forward by no more than $$$a_i$$$ units. In other words, if it was at integer point $$$k$$$, after the jump it can land\nat any integer point from $$$k$$$ to $$$k+a_i$$$\n.\nBut magic always comes with a price; it has been cursed. Before each $$$b_i$$$-th attempt (before $$$b_i$$$-th, $$$2b_i$$$-th, $$$3b_i$$$-th etc. attempt among the jumps of type $$$i$$$) to use the $$$i$$$-th type of jump, the frog rolls back $$$c_i$$$ units! In other words, if it was at point $$$k$$$, it will first find itself at point $$$k-c_i$$$, and after the jump, it can land at any integer point from $$$k-c_i$$$ to $$$k-c_i+a_i$$$.\nThe frog's goal is to reach the point with the number $$$x$$$, using jumps while minimizing the number of rollbacks. Help the frog — find the minimum number of rollbacks it will have to endure on its way to the goal, or determine that it cannot reach point $$$x$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nIn the first line of each test case, there are $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq x \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the number of types of jumps the frog can make and its final target.\nIn the following $$$n$$$ lines, the description of the jump types is provided; the $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$3$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i, b_i, c_i \\leq 10^6$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, if the frog can reach point $$$x$$$, find the smallest number of rollbacks it must endure to do so. If it cannot reach point $$$x$$$, output $$$-1$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the frog can jump forward by $$$1$$$ unit and will end up at point $$$1$$$. Thus, the answer is $$$0$$$.\nIn the third test case, it can be shown that the frog cannot reach point $$$4$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, the frog can reach point $$$8$$$, for example, as follows: jump using the $$$1$$$-st type by $$$12$$$, jump using the $$$4$$$-th type by $$$1$$$, and jump using the $$$2$$$-nd type by $$$10$$$. Then it will sequentially be at the following points $$$0 \\rightarrow \\text{(rollback)} -11 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\text{(rollback)} -2 \\rightarrow 8$$$.\nIn the sixth test case, the frog can reach point $$$10$$$, for example, as follows: jump $$$6$$$ times by $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ time by $$$1$$$. Then it will sequentially be at the following points $$$0 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\text{(rollback)} 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow \\text{(rollback)} 4 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow \\text{(rollback)} 7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 10$$$.",
