    "statement": "Mass Hysteria\n(Hearthstone)\n$$$\\color{white}{\\text{You are sus}}$$$\nFranklin is plotting a Christmas attack where he casts the spell\nMass Hysteria\non a village of elves.\nThere are $$$n$$$ elves numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where elf $$$i$$$ has a health value of $$$h_i$$$ and an attack value of $$$a_i$$$.\nInitially, $$$h_i=a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$, and all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.\nElf $$$i$$$ is alive if and only if its health is positive (i.e., $$$h_i>0$$$).\nWhen Franklin casts\nMass Hysteria\n, the following process is repeated:\nChoose a pair of distinct living elves $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$h_x,h_y>0$$$) such that elf $$$x$$$ has\nnot\nattacked before. If no such pair exists, terminate the process.\nThen, elf $$$x$$$ attacks elf $$$y$$$, decreasing $$$h_y$$$ by $$$a_x$$$. Additionally, due to recoil, $$$h_x$$$ is decreased by $$$a_y$$$. Note that $$$a_x$$$ and $$$a_y$$$ remain unchanged.\nThe process will repeat until it is impossible to choose a valid pair of elves. It can be shown that\nMass Hysteria\nterminates after at most $$$n$$$ iterations.\nGiven an integer $$$m$$$, construct a valid sequence of attacks such that exactly $$$m$$$ elves are alive when the process ends; or determine that no such sequence exists.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5, 0\\le m\\le n$$$) — the number of elves in the village and the number of elves to be left alive.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$) — the initial attack\nand\nhealth values of the elves.\nIt is guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, if it is impossible for exactly $$$m$$$ elves to remain alive, print $$$-1$$$.\nOtherwise, output a valid sequence of attacks as follows:\nOn the first line, output an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0\\le k\\le n$$$) — the number of iterations in\nMass Hysteria\n.\nThen $$$k$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1\\leq x_i,y_i\\leq n$$$, $$$x_i\\neq y_i$$$), indicating that elf $$$x_i$$$ attacks elf $$$y_i$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th iteration.\nThe sequence must satisfy all of the following conditions:\nImmediately before the $$$i$$$-th iteration, both elves $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ are alive and elf $$$x_i$$$ has not attacked in any previous iteration.\nAfter the $$$k$$$-th iteration, exactly $$$m$$$ elves are alive and there does not exist a pair of distinct living elves $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that elf $$$x$$$ has not attacked before.\nIf there are multiple answers, you may output any of them. Any valid sequence satisfying the above conditions will be accepted.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, one possible sequence of attacks is shown below:\n#\n$$$x$$$\n$$$y$$$\nHealth values after attack\nElves that have attacked\n0\n—\n—\n$$$[1, 4, 2, 3]$$$\n$$$[]$$$\n1\n$$$3$$$\n$$$1$$$\n$$$[-1, 4, 1, 3]$$$\n$$$[3]$$$\n2\n$$$2$$$\n$$$4$$$\n$$$[-1, 1, 1, -1]$$$\n$$$[2, 3]$$$\nAfter $$$2$$$ iterations, only elves $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ are alive. Since both of them have already attacked, no further valid attack is possible, and\nMass Hysteria\nterminates.\nIn the second test case, the only possible choices for $$$(x,y)$$$ in the first iteration are $$$(1,2)$$$ or $$$(2,1)$$$. In either case, elf $$$1$$$ ends up with $$$-1$$$ health, so it is impossible for both elves to remain alive at the end. Note that\nMass Hysteria\nwill last at least one iteration as there exists a valid $$$(x,y)$$$ for the first iteration.\nIn the sixth test case, only elf $$$3$$$ is alive after all attacks. Even though elf $$$3$$$ has not attacked before,\nMass Hysteria\nterminates since there is no other elf it can attack.",
