    "statement": "You are given a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. You also own a binary$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ where $$$s_i = \\mathtt{0}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. You may do the following operation at most $$$5$$$ times:\nChoose any two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$. Then, for every $$$i$$$ such that $$$l < i < r$$$ and $$$\\min(p_l, p_r) < p_i < \\max(p_l, p_r)$$$ hold at the same time, you will set $$$s_i$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$.\nYou are also given a binary string $$$x$$$ of size $$$n$$$. After performing operations, it must hold for every $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ that if $$$x_i = \\mathtt{1}$$$, then $$$s_i = \\mathtt{1}$$$. Note that if $$$x_i = \\mathtt{0}$$$, then $$$s_i$$$ can have\nany\nvalue.\nFigure out any sequence of\nat most $$$5$$$\noperations such that the aforementioned condition is satisfied, or report that it is impossible to do so. Note that you\ndo not\nhave to minimize the number of operations you make.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation $$$p$$$ of every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is a sequence of elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that every element appears exactly once.\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A string $$$b$$$ of size $$$m$$$ is considered binary if and only if $$$b_i = \\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$b_i = \\mathtt{1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.\nThe second line contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$, the elements of $$$p$$$ are pairwise distinct) — where $$$p_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the permutation.\nThe third line contains a single binary string $$$x$$$ of size $$$n$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, if it is impossible to perform operations such that the constraint is satisfied, output $$$-1$$$.\nOtherwise, output an integer $$$0 \\le k \\le 5$$$, the number of operations. On the $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines, output two integers $$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$, the bounds of the $$$i$$$-th operation that is performed. If there are multiple correct solutions, output any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, $$$p = [1, 2, 3]$$$, and $$$x = \\mathtt{010}$$$. We can perform a single operation, with $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$. After the operation, we set $$$s_2$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ since $$$l < 2 < r$$$ and $$$\\min(p_l, p_r) < p_2 = 2 < \\max(p_l, p_r)$$$ hold at the same time. As a result, $$$s = \\mathtt{010}$$$.\nIn the second example, it can be shown that there does not exist a correct sequence of at most $$$5$$$ operations, so we output $$$-1$$$.\nIn the third example, $$$p = [1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5]$$$ and $$$x = \\mathtt{001100}$$$. After performing an operation for $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$, then $$$s = \\mathtt{011100}$$$. If we also perform an operation for $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 6$$$, then $$$s$$$ will remain the same. The string $$$s = \\mathtt{011100}$$$ is valid, because for every position where $$$x$$$ has a $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$, then $$$s$$$ also has a $$$\\mathtt{1}$$$ at that position.",
