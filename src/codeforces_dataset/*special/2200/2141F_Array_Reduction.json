    "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ containing $$$n$$$ integers.\nIn one operation, you can choose some elements from this array and remove them. However, the elements you choose must meet one of the following conditions:\neither all chosen elements are equal;\nor there are no two equal chosen elements.\nNote that if you choose only $$$1$$$ element to remove, it automatically meets these conditions.\nFor example, if $$$a = \\{1, 2, 1, 1, 3\\}$$$, some of the possible elements you can remove in one operation are:\nthe $$$1$$$-st element;\nthe $$$1$$$-st and the $$$3$$$-rd element;\nthe $$$1$$$-st, the $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$4$$$-th element;\nthe $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$4$$$-th element;\nthe $$$2$$$-nd, the $$$4$$$-th and the $$$5$$$-th element;\nand many others.\nHowever, you cannot choose the $$$2$$$-nd, the $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$4$$$-th element because the $$$2$$$-nd element is not equal to the $$$4$$$-th, but the $$$3$$$-rd element is equal to the $$$4$$$-th.\nFor each $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, you have to calculate the minimum number of operations required to decrease the size of the array to\nexactly\n$$$x$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of two lines:\nthe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array;\nthe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the array itself.\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$$$, where $$$c_i$$$ is the minimum number of operations required to reduce the size of the array to exactly $$$i$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, the answer can be obtained as follows:\n$$$c_{0} = 3$$$: remove $$$a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$; then remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$$$; then remove $$$a_{5}, a_{6}, a_{7}$$$;\n$$$c_{1} = 3$$$: remove $$$a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$; then remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$$$; then remove $$$a_{5}, a_{6}$$$;\n$$$c_{2} = 2$$$: remove $$$a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$; then remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$$$;\n$$$c_{3} = 2$$$: remove $$$a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$; then remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}$$$;\n$$$c_{4} = 2$$$: remove $$$a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$; then remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}$$$;\n$$$c_{5} = 1$$$: remove $$$a_{1}, a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$;\n$$$c_{6} = 1$$$: remove $$$a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}$$$;\n$$$c_{7} = 1$$$: remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$$$;\n$$$c_{8} = 1$$$: remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}$$$;\n$$$c_{9} = 1$$$: remove $$$a_{1}, a_{2}$$$;\n$$$c_{10} = 1$$$: remove $$$a_{7}$$$;",
