    "statement": "On a Cartesian plane, there are $$$n$$$ distinct points painted black, while all other points are painted white. Each black point has integer coordinates.\nThere is also a robot that can move one unit in any of the directions '\nU\n' (up), '\nD\n' (down), '\nL\n' (left), or '\nR\n' (right) with a single command.\nA path of the robot from point $$$p_{1}$$$ to point $$$p_{2}$$$ is a sequence of commands such that if the robot, starting at point $$$p_{1}$$$, executes this sequence, it will arrive at point $$$p_{2}$$$.\nThe shortest path of the robot from point $$$p_{1}$$$ to point $$$p_{2}$$$ is a path whose sequence consists of the minimum possible number of commands.\nYou need to count the number of pairs of points $$$p_i$$$, $$$p_j$$$ ($$$i \\neq j$$$) such that for this pair of points the following condition holds:\nAll\npoints with integer coordinates on\nany\nshortest path of the robot from point $$$p_{i}$$$ to point $$$p_{j}$$$ are painted black.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the number of points painted black.\nThe next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case contain two integers $$$x_{i}, y_{i}$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\le x_{i}, y_{i} \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the coordinates of point $$$p_{i}$$$. All points are pairwise distinct.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the answer to the problem.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, there are $$$16$$$ suitable pairs of points:\n$$$p_{1}, p_{2}$$$\n$$$p_{1}, p_{3}$$$\n$$$p_{1}, p_{4}$$$\n$$$p_{1}, p_{5}$$$\n$$$p_{2}, p_{1}$$$\n$$$p_{2}, p_{3}$$$\n$$$p_{2}, p_{4}$$$\n$$$p_{2}, p_{5}$$$\n$$$p_{3}, p_{1}$$$\n$$$p_{3}, p_{2}$$$\n$$$p_{3}, p_{4}$$$\n$$$p_{4}, p_{1}$$$\n$$$p_{4}, p_{2}$$$\n$$$p_{4}, p_{3}$$$\n$$$p_{5}, p_{1}$$$\n$$$p_{5}, p_{2}$$$",
