    "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_n$$$. Your task is to make all elements of $$$a$$$ equal. In order to do it, you can perform the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times:\nchoose any index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and increase $$$a_i$$$ by one.\nYou can choose any element of the array, but if the chosen $$$a_i$$$ is\nstrictly greater\nthan the\ncurrent\nminimum of the array, you'll earn one coin.\nWhat is the maximum number of coins you can earn among all possible ways to make the array equal?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Next, $$$t$$$ cases follow (all cases are independent).\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$) — the size of array $$$a$$$ and the maximum number of operations you can perform.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array itself.\nIt's guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, if it's impossible to make all elements equal, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print the maximum number of coins you can earn while making all elements equal.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, you need at least $$$17$$$ operations to make all elements equal (or to get the array $$$[10, 10, 10]$$$).\nIn the second test case, you can, for example, increase $$$a_3 = 4$$$ to $$$10$$$, then increase $$$a_1 = 6$$$ to $$$10$$$, after that increase $$$a_4 = 9$$$ to $$$10$$$ and, finally, $$$a_2 = 2$$$ to $$$10$$$. You'll perform $$$19$$$ operations and earn $$$(10 - 4) + (10 - 6) + (10 - 9) = 11$$$ coins in total, since increasing the $$$a_2$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$10$$$ won't give you any coins.\nIn the third test case, you can leave the array unchanged or make all elements equal to $$$8$$$ — both strategies will give you $$$0$$$ coins.",
