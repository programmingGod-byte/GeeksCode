    "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, where all numbers are from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^{12} - 1$$$.\nYou have to process $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is defined by three integers $$$l_i, r_i, x_i$$$: you need to find the smallest set $$$S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k\\}$$$ that satisfies the following conditions:\neach $$$s_j$$$ is equal to some element from the subarray from the $$$l_i$$$-th position to the $$$r_i$$$-th position inclusive;\n$$$s_1 \\oplus s_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus s_k = x_i$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes bitwise XOR.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2^{12} - 1$$$).\nThe third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^6$$$).\nThen $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains three integers $$$l_i, r_i, x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$; $$$1 \\le x_i \\le 2^{12} - 1$$$).",

    "note": "Note\nConsider the queries from the example:\nin the first query, you can choose $$$S = \\{5, 4\\}$$$;\nin the second query, you can choose $$$S = \\{1\\}$$$;\nin the third query, you can choose $$$S = \\{4, 3, 5\\}$$$;\nin the fourth query, you can choose $$$S = \\{1, 3, 7\\}$$$.",
