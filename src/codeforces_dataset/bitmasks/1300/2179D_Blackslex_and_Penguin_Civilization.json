    "statement": "Penguins are civilized creatures that communicate using permutations. Blackslex, as a penguin researcher, must study their means of communication.\nFor a given integer $$$n$$$, consider permutations$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of the array $$$[0, 1, \\ldots, 2^n - 1]$$$. Define $$$$$$S(p) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \\operatorname{popcount}\\!\\bigl(p_0 \\mathbin{\\&} p_1 \\mathbin{\\&} \\cdots \\mathbin{\\&} p_i\\bigr),$$$$$$ where $$$\\operatorname{popcount}(z)$$$ is the number of $$$1$$$-bits in the binary representation of $$$z$$$ (for instance, $$$\\operatorname{popcount}(5) = 2$$$ because $$$5 = 101_2$$$ has two $$$1$$$-bits in the binary representation), and $$$\\&$$$ denotes the\nbitwise AND operation\n. .\nA permutation is considered\nsacred\nif it maximizes $$$S(p)$$$. Find the\nlexicographically minimal\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ sacred permutation.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$b$$$ of the same size if and only if the following holds:\nin the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the array $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 16$$$) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 16$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$2^n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2^{16}$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output $$$2^n$$$ integers $$$p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{2^n-1}$$$ — the required permutation.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, there are two possible permutations.\n$$$p = [0, 1]$$$, $$$S(p) = 0$$$\n$$$p = [1, 0]$$$, $$$S(p) = 1$$$\nFor the second test case, $$$S([3, 1, 0, 2]) = 3$$$ is sacred. There are other permutations $$$p$$$ that are sacred, such as $$$p = [3, 2, 0, 1]$$$, but those are not lexicographically minimal.",
