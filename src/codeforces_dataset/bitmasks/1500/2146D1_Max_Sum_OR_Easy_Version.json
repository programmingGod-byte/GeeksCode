    "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, $$$l=0$$$, and $$$r<2\\cdot 10^5$$$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\nYou are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l\\le r$$$).\nLet $$$n = r - l + 1$$$. We will create two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Initially, both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are equal to $$$[l, l+1, \\ldots, r]$$$. You have to reorder the array $$$a$$$ arbitrarily to maximize the following value:\n$$$$$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left (a_i\\;|\\;b_i \\right ).$$$$$$\nHere, $$$|$$$ denotes the\nbitwise OR operation\n.\nYou also need to construct a possible way to reorder the array $$$a$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$0=l\\leq r<2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the minimum and maximum elements in $$$a$$$.\nLet $$$n = r - l + 1$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer in the first line of output — the maximum value of $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\left (a_i\\;|\\;b_i \\right )$$$.\nThen, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n$$$ in the second line — the array $$$a$$$ after reordering.\nIf there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the reordered array $$$a$$$ is $$$[3,2,1,0]$$$. The value of the expression is $$$(3\\;|\\;0)+(2\\;|\\;1)+(1\\;|\\;2)+(0\\;|\\;3)=3+3+3+3=12$$$. It can be proved that this is the maximum possible value of the expression.\nIn the second test case, the reordered array $$$a$$$ is $$$[7,8,5,4,3,2,9,0,1,6]$$$. The value of the expression is $$$90$$$. It can be proved that this is the maximum possible value of the expression.",
