    "statement": "Due to supply chain issues in the North Pole (allegedly caused by a lazy elf), Santa is planning to give out hand-drawn circles as presents this Christmas. Please help him decorate them!\nThere are $$$2n$$$ equally spaced points around the circle, labeled $$$1,2,\\ldots,2n$$$ in clockwise order. Santa has chosen $$$n$$$ chords with\ndistinct\nendpoints, where chord $$$i$$$ connects the points $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. He draws these chords onto the circle one by one, in order.\nAfter Santa has drawn the first $$$\\ell$$$ chords, consider any non-empty subset $$$S$$$ of the $$$\\ell$$$ chords and let $$$1\\leq c_1<c_2<\\cdots<c_{|S|}\\leq \\ell$$$ be their indices. $$$S$$$ is defined to be a\nchain\nif and only if chord $$$c_k$$$ intersects chord $$$c_{k+1}$$$ for all $$$1\\leq k < |S|$$$. Note that $$$S$$$ is always a\nchain\nif $$$|S|=1$$$.\nSanta does not want any chord to be the odd one out. Therefore, he considers the chords to be\ntight-knit\nif and only if every chord appears in an even number of\nchains\n, taken over all\nchains\nthat are subsets of the first $$$\\ell$$$ chords.\nFor each $$$\\ell$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, help Santa determine whether his chords are\ntight-knit\n.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 5\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of chords.\nThen $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i<b_i\\le 2n$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th chord.\nIt is guaranteed that all endpoints are distinct.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a string of length $$$n$$$ — the $$$\\ell$$$-th character should be $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ if the first $$$\\ell$$$ chords are\ntight-knit\nand $$$\\texttt{0}$$$ otherwise.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, no pairs of chords intersect, and thus every chord appears in exactly one\nchain\nconsisting of itself. Therefore, the chords are not\ntight-knit\nfor all $$$\\ell$$$.\nIn the second test case, below is an illustration and explanation after the first $$$\\ell=1,2,3,4$$$ chords are drawn. Sets of chords are denoted as a set of the indices of the corresponding chords.\nExplanation\nIllustration\nChains\n$$$\\{1\\}$$$.\nAppearances\nChord $$$1$$$ appears in $$$1$$$\nchain\n.\nNotes\nThe chords are not\ntight-knit\nsince chord $$$1$$$ is in an odd number of\nchains\n.\nRecall that a set containing a single chord is always a\nchain\n.\nChains\n$$$\\{1\\}$$$, $$$\\{1,2\\}$$$, and $$$\\{2\\}$$$.\nAppearances\nChord $$$1$$$ appears in $$$2$$$\nchains\n;\nChord $$$2$$$ appears in $$$2$$$\nchains\n.\nNotes\nThe chords are\ntight-knit\nsince every chord appears in an even number of\nchains\n.\nChains\n$$$\\{1\\}$$$, $$$\\{1,2\\}$$$, $$$\\{2\\}$$$, and $$$\\{3\\}$$$.\nAppearances\nChord $$$1$$$ appears in $$$2$$$\nchains\n;\nChord $$$2$$$ appears in $$$2$$$\nchains\n;\nChord $$$3$$$ appears in $$$1$$$\nchain\n.\nNotes\nThe chords are not\ntight-knit\nsince chord $$$3$$$ is in an odd number of\nchains\n.\nChains\n$$$\\{1\\}$$$, $$$\\{1,2\\}$$$, $$$\\{1,2,4\\}$$$, $$$\\{2\\}$$$, $$$\\{2,4\\}$$$, $$$\\{3\\}$$$, $$$\\{3,4\\}$$$, and $$$\\{4\\}$$$.\nAppearances\nChord $$$1$$$ appears in $$$3$$$\nchains\n;\nChord $$$2$$$ appears in $$$4$$$\nchains\n;\nChord $$$3$$$ appears in $$$2$$$\nchains\n;\nChord $$$4$$$ appears in $$$4$$$\nchains\n.\nNotes\nThe chords are not\ntight-knit\nsince chord $$$1$$$ is in an odd number of\nchains\n.\nNote that $$$\\{2,3,4\\}$$$ is\nnot\na\nchain\nsince chord $$$2$$$ does not intersect chord $$$3$$$.\nThus, we output $$$\\mathtt{0100}$$$.",
