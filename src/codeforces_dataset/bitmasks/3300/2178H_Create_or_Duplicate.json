    "statement": "Santa realized that hand-drawing circles takes too long, so he has turned to magic to meet his production quotas.\nThere are three types of presents with distinct values $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$. Initially, Santa has\nexactly one\npresent of each type.\nYou are given two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$, representing Santa's favorite number and the cost of duplication, respectively. Santa can cast the following two types of spells any number of times (possibly zero):\nCreate — Choose a type of present and create one additional present of that type. This spell costs $$$x$$$ mana, where $$$x\\in \\{a,b,c\\}$$$ is the value of the chosen type.\nDuplicate — Choose a type of present and duplicate all presents of that type. This spell costs $$$k$$$ mana.\nSanta wants to perform a sequence of spells such that the sum of the values of all presents is a multiple of $$$m$$$ after the spells.\nDetermine the minimum amount of mana Santa needs to achieve this. It can be shown that, under the given constraints, such a sequence of spells always exists.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains five integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\\leq a< b< c< m\\leq 5\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq k\\leq 5\\cdot 10^5$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum amount of mana Santa needs to make the sum of the values of all presents a multiple of $$$m$$$.",
