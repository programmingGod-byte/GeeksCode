    "statement": "This problem is a run-twice (communication) problem.\nAlice has an integer $$$x$$$ where $$$1 \\le x \\le 2^{15}$$$, which she needs to send to Bob (an astronaut on the Moon) as it is an important parameter for their secret project on the Moon.\nFortunately, Alice has a secret storage device $$$S$$$, which contains a\nnot necessarily non-empty\nsubset of the set $$$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$$$. She plans to send $$$S$$$ to Bob. Bob's goal is to recover the value of $$$x$$$ using only $$$S$$$.\nHowever, after Alice sends set $$$S$$$ on a spaceship and before Bob receives $$$S$$$, magical butterflies had intercepted the spaceship! When Bob finally receives $$$S$$$, one of the following had occurred:\nAn arbitrary element is removed from $$$S$$$. This can only be done if $$$S$$$ is non-empty.\nAn arbitrary element is added to $$$S$$$. This should still satisfy $$$S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$$$.\n$$$S$$$ remained unchanged.\nPlease devise a strategy for Alice and Bob so that Bob can determine the value of $$$x$$$ regardless of what happened to set $$$S$$$. Precisely, in this problem your code will be run exactly two times on each test. On the first run, you will act as Alice, and on the second Bob. No additional information other than the set $$$S$$$ can be transferred from Alice to Bob. To get an\nAccepted\nverdict, your code on the second run should be able to exactly recover the integers that were received on the first run.\nFirst Run\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains the string\nfirst\n. The purpose of this is so your program recognizes that this is its first run, and it should act as Alice.\nThe second line of the input contains exactly one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first and only line of the $$$i$$$-th test case contains an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 2^{15}$$$).\nOutput\nFor each test case, send $$$S$$$ to Bob by printing two lines in the following manner.\nOn the first line, output an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \\le n \\le 20$$$) — the size of $$$S$$$.\nOn the second line, output $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$S_1,S_2,\\ldots,S_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le S_i \\le 20$$$).\nExceptionally, you may omit the second line if $$$n=0$$$. You may output elements of $$$S$$$ in any order. However, they must be pairwise distinct.\nThen, you will either proceed to the next test case, or your program must terminate if you have processed every test case.\nSecond Run\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains the string\nsecond\n. The purpose of this is so your program recognizes that this is its second run, and it should act as Bob.\nThe second line of the input contains exactly one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Note that this number is equal to $$$t$$$ from the first run input.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n'$$$ ($$$0 \\leq n' \\leq 20$$$) — the size of the set $$$S'$$$ that Bob receives, that is, possibly\nmodified\n$$$S$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq S'_i \\leq 20$$$) — the elements of the $$$S'$$$ that Bob receives.\nThe elements of $$$S'$$$ are sorted in increasing order, even if the original $$$S$$$ is not sorted in increasing order.\nNote that the test cases in the second run may be shuffled\n. Please see the example input for more details.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line with the value of $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq 2^{15}$$$).",

    "note": "Note\nFirst run\n: The input contains four test cases with $$$x=1, 20, 50, 32\\,768$$$. According to some strategy agreed upon beforehand, Alice sends $$$\\varnothing$$$ to Bob for $$$x=1$$$, the set $$$\\{13,4,9\\}$$$ for $$$x=20$$$, the set $$$\\{1,7,4,2\\}$$$ for $$$x=50$$$, and $$$\\{14,17,1,6,2,19,20,8,7,18\\}$$$ for $$$32\\,768$$$.\nSecond run\n: Note that the test cases from the first run are shuffled. They are given in the order $$$[20, 32\\,768, 1, 50]$$$.\nFor the first test case, the element $$$5$$$ is added to Alice's set. Note that although Alice gave the initial set as $$$\\{13,4,9\\}$$$, the set was given in increasing order to Bob.\nFor the second test case, the number $$$20$$$ was removed from Alice's set.\nFor the third test case, the set was unchanged.",
