    "statement": "Zeus is analyzing a replay of the fight to understand his opponent's attack patterns. The opponent has a special ability: if they land three attacks on a target within a time frame of $$$z$$$, their third attack becomes a powerful, boosted attack.\nTo outplay his opponent, Zeus should not let his opponent trigger their boosted attack. Let $$$Y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m\\}$$$ be the multiset of $$$m$$$ timestamps, where each $$$y_i$$$ represents the time when the opponent's attack landed. We call $$$Y$$$ to be\nsafe\nif for every three timestamps $$$\\{y_i, y_j, y_k\\}$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  j  \\lt  k \\le m$$$, it holds that $$$\\max(y_i, y_j, y_k) - \\min(y_i, y_j, y_k)  \\gt  z$$$, where $$$z$$$ is the duration of the time frame that is given to you as an input.\nZeus has a log of $$$n$$$ timestamps, $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$, representing when the opponent's attacks landed. The timestamps are\nsorted in nondecreasing order\nof occurrence. In other words, $$$x_i \\le x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  n$$$.\nZeus has $$$q$$$ intervals of interest, denoted as two integers $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$. For each interval, Zeus wants to find the maximum number of attacks among $$$[x_l, x_{l+1}, \\ldots, x_r]$$$ that he could have let through: In other words, Zeus wants to find a maximum size subset of the multiset $$$\\{x_l, x_{l+1}, \\ldots, x_r\\}$$$ such that the subset is\nsafe\n.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20\\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 250\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le z \\le 10^9$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the timestamps of the opponent's attacks. It is guaranteed that the array $$$x$$$ is sorted, i.e., $$$x_i \\le x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  n$$$.\nThe third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 250\\,000$$$).\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) — the endpoints of the interval.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\\,000$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\\,000$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each of the $$$q$$$ queries, print a single integer — the maximum size of a safe subset of attack timestamps in the given interval.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first query of the first test case, we consider the timestamps $$$\\{1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12\\}$$$ with $$$z=10$$$. The subset $$$\\{1, 5, 12\\}$$$ is safe because its only triplet satisfies $$$12 - 1 = 11  \\gt  10$$$. It's impossible to form a safe subset of size $$$4$$$, hence the answer to this query is $$$3$$$.\nIn the first query of the second test case, we consider the timestamps $$$\\{1\\}$$$ with $$$z=1$$$. The entire set $$$\\{1\\}$$$ is safe because there are no triplets. Hence the answer to this query is $$$1$$$.\nIn the second query of the second test case, we consider the timestamps $$$\\{1,1,1,3,3,3\\}$$$ with $$$z=1$$$.\nThe subset $$$S = \\{1,1,3,3\\}$$$ is safe because:\nFor the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (1,2,3)$$$, $$$\\max(1,1,3) - \\min(1,1,3) = 2  \\gt  1$$$.\nFor the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (1,2,4)$$$, $$$\\max(1,1,3) - \\min(1,1,3) = 2  \\gt  1$$$.\nFor the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (1,3,4)$$$, $$$\\max(1,3,3) - \\min(1,3,3) = 2  \\gt  1$$$.\nFor the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (2,3,4)$$$, $$$\\max(1,3,3) - \\min(1,3,3) = 2  \\gt  1$$$.\nIt's impossible to form a safe subset of size $$$5$$$, hence the answer to this query is $$$4$$$.",
