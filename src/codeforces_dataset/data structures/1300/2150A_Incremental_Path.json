    "statement": "Rymdkraft - Rymdsylt\n⠀\nHacks are disabled in this problem.\nThere is a strip containing $$$10^9$$$ cells, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^9$$$. Each cell is either black or white. Initially, $$$m$$$ distinct cells $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$ are black, and the others are white.\nIf a person is on some cell $$$x$$$, he might be given two types of commands:\n$$$\\texttt{A}$$$: jump to the next cell, i.e. cell $$$x + 1$$$;\n$$$\\texttt{B}$$$: jump to the next white cell, i.e. the minimum $$$y > x$$$ such that cell $$$y$$$ is white.\nThere is a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ commands. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in order, a person\nstarts from cell $$$1$$$;\nexecutes the first $$$i$$$ commands in the string;\ncolors the last visited cell black (if it was already black, it remains black).\nYou wonder which cells are black at the end of the process. Print them in increasing order.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of commands and the number of black cells at the beginning.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters $$$\\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, representing the commands.\nThe third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_m \\leq 10^9$$$) — the initial black cells.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print two lines:\nin the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$: the number of black cells at the end;\nin the second line, print the labels of the black cells, in increasing order.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, initially the only black cells are $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$.\nPerson $$$1$$$:\nstarts from cell $$$1$$$;\nexecutes command $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, going to the next white cell ($$$3$$$);\ncolors cell $$$3$$$ black.\nPerson $$$2$$$:\nstarts from cell $$$1$$$;\nexecutes command $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, going to the next white cell ($$$4$$$);\nexecutes command $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, going to the next cell ($$$5$$$);\ncolors cell $$$5$$$ black (it was already black, so it remains black).\nPerson $$$3$$$:\nstarts from cell $$$1$$$;\nexecutes command $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, going to the next white cell ($$$4$$$);\nexecutes command $$$\\texttt{A}$$$, going to the next cell ($$$5$$$);\nexecutes command $$$\\texttt{B}$$$, going to the next white cell ($$$6$$$);\ncolors cell $$$6$$$ black.\nAt the end, the black cells are $$$\\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$$$.\nIn the second test case, the three people end up in cells $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$6$$$, respectively.",
