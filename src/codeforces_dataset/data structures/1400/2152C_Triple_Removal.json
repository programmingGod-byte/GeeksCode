    "statement": "Tired of supporting ranged carries, Keria is now creating a data structure problem about supporting range queries.\nFor an array $$$b = [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m]$$$ of length $$$m$$$ where $$$b_i=0$$$ or $$$b_i=1$$$, consider the following\ntriple removal\noperation:\nChoose three indices $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  j  \\lt  k \\le m$$$ such that the elements at these positions are identical ($$$b_i = b_j = b_k$$$).\nRemove these three elements from the array. The cost of this operation is defined as $$$\\min(k-j, j-i)$$$. After the removal, the remaining parts of the array are concatenated, and their indices are relabeled.\nWe want to make the array $$$b$$$ empty using the\ntriple removal\noperation. Hence, we define the\ntotal cost\nof an array as the minimum possible sum of the costs of\ntriple removal\noperations required to make the array empty. If it is impossible to make the array empty, the cost is defined to be $$$-1$$$.\nKeria wants to test his data structure. For this, you must answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. Initially, you are given an array $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$ of length $$$n$$$ where $$$a_i=0$$$ or $$$a_i=1$$$. For each query, you are given a range $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and must find the cost for the array $$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r]$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, q \\le 250\\,000$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.\nThe next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 0$$$ or $$$a_i=1$$$) — the elements of the array.\nThen $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$) — the range of the subarray for the $$$i$$$-th query.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\\,000$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\\,000$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain a single integer representing the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.",
    "note": "Note\nExplanation of the first test case, first query (1 12):\nThe subarray is $$$[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]$$$. There are six $$$0$$$s and six $$$1$$$s. A possible optimal sequence of operations is:\nRemove the three $$$1$$$s at indices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$6$$$. The cost is $$$\\min(6-4, 4-3) = \\min(2, 1) = 1$$$. The array becomes $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]$$$.\nRemove the three $$$0$$$s at indices $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. The cost is $$$\\min(3-2, 2-1) = \\min(1, 1) = 1$$$. The array becomes $$$[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]$$$.\nRemove the three $$$1$$$s at indices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$. The cost is $$$\\min(5-4, 4-2) = \\min(1, 2) = 1$$$. The array becomes $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$.\nRemove the three $$$0$$$s at indices $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. The cost is $$$\\min(3-2, 2-1) = \\min(1, 1) = 1$$$. The array is now empty.\nThe total cost is $$$1+1+1+1=4$$$.",
