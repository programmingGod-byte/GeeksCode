    "statement": "Alice and Bob play a turn-based game. Initially, Alice has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and Bob has an array $$$b$$$ of $$$m$$$ positive integers. The players take turns, with Alice moving first.\nOn a player's turn, they must choose one element $$$x$$$ from their own array and\nthe maximal\nelement $$$y$$$ from their opponent's array. Then they perform the following operation:\nIf $$$y \\leq x$$$: the element $$$y$$$ is destroyed (removed from the opponent's array).\nIf $$$y  \\gt  x$$$: the element $$$y$$$ is decreased by $$$x$$$ (the value of $$$y$$$ becomes $$$y - x$$$).\nA player wins if, after their move, the opponent's array becomes empty.\nAssuming both players play optimally, determine the winner.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach input contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$).\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,m \\le 10^5$$$) — the sizes of Alice's and Bob's arrays respectively.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — Alice's array.\nThe third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — Bob's array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print the name of the winner of the game if both players follow the optimal strategy: \"\nAlice\n\" or \"\nBob\n\".",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test Alice moves and decreases Bob's element by $$$70$$$, so it becomes $$$20$$$. Then Bob moves and decreases Alice's element by $$$20$$$, so it becomes $$$50$$$. Finally, Alice moves, destroys Bob's element, and wins.",
