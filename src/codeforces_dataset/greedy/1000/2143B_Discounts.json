    "statement": "You want to buy $$$n$$$ products with prices $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. You can either:\nbuy product $$$i$$$ individually, paying $$$a_i$$$ coins, or\nuse a discount voucher to buy it as part of a group purchase.\nYou have $$$k$$$ discount vouchers with values $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$. A voucher of value $$$x$$$ allows you to select exactly $$$x$$$ products and pay only for the $$$x - 1$$$ most expensive ones, as such, you can consider that the cheapest product in the group is free. Each product can be included in\nat most one\ndiscount group, even if it is not the free one. Also, any single voucher can be used at most one single time.\nWhat is the\nminimum total cost\nrequired to purchase all $$$n$$$ products?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) —the number of products and the number of available discount vouchers.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the prices of the products.\nThe third line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$) — the values of the discount vouchers.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$k$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nPrint $$$t$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer for the $$$i$$$-th test case — the minimum total cost required to purchase all products in that test case.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, you can apply the first discount to products 2, 3, and 4. You will pay for the two most expensive ones (3 and 7 coins) and get the cheapest one for free, resulting in a cost of $$$3 + 7 = 10$$$ coins. Then, apply the second and third discounts to products 1 and 5, getting both for free. The total cost is $$$10$$$ coins.\nIn the second test case, you can use the single discount on products 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Among them, the cheapest is product 2 (costing 2 coins), which you get for free. You pay for the remaining products: $$$1 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 17$$$ coins in total.\nIn the third test case, only one discount is available. You can use it on both products, getting the cheaper one for free and paying $$$1$$$ coin for the other.",
