    "statement": "The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. A single lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. Ding! Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!...\nFarmer John is running the FitnessGram Pacer Test! Farmer John takes\none minute\nto run to the other side of the gym. Therefore, at the start of each minute, FJ can choose to either run to the other side of the gym or stay in place. If he chooses to run to the other side of the gym, he gains\none point\n.\nFJ will run the Pacer Test until the start of the $$$m$$$-th minute. Initially (at the start of the $$$0$$$-th minute), FJ is at the starting side of the gym, which we will denote as side $$$0$$$. The opposite side of the gym is denoted side $$$1$$$.\nThe pacer test audio plays $$$n$$$ times. At the start of the $$$a_i$$$-th minute, FJ must be at the $$$b_i$$$-th side of the gym.\nWhat is the maximum number of points FJ can acquire while ensuring that he meets the audio's requirements?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, n \\leq m \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of requirements and the number of total minutes.\nThe following $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq a_i \\leq m, b_i \\in \\{0,1\\})$$$ — the $$$i$$$-th requirement by the audio. It is guaranteed that $$$a_i  \\gt  a_{i-1}$$$ over all $$$i  \\gt  1$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of points that FJ can acquire.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first sample test case,\nDuring minute $$$0$$$, FJ can stay at side $$$0$$$.\nDuring minute $$$1$$$, FJ can run to side $$$1$$$ and gain $$$1$$$ point.\nRight before minute $$$2$$$, the audio requires FJ to be at side $$$1$$$. Here, FJ is indeed at side $$$1$$$.\nDuring minute $$$2$$$, FJ can run to side $$$0$$$ and gain $$$1$$$ point.\nDuring minute $$$3$$$, FJ can stay at side $$$0$$$.\nRight before minute $$$4$$$, the audio requires FJ to be at side $$$0$$$. Here, FJ is indeed at side $$$0$$$.\nSince the start of minute $$$4$$$ has reached, the Pacer Test ends. His total score is $$$2$$$.\nRelevant illustration of the statement:",
