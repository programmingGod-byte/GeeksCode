    "statement": "You got lucky to know the answer to all important questions in the world. This time, the answer is the string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters only. You want to hide this string.\nYou have another string $$$t$$$ also consisting of lowercase English letters only. You need to shuffle the letters in $$$t$$$ so that the string $$$s$$$ appears at least once in $$$t$$$ as a subsequence$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Among all possible reorderings of $$$t$$$ containing $$$s$$$ as a subsequence, find the lexicographically smallest$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ one.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:\n$$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; or\nin the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$$$), where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string $$$t$$$ ($$$|s| \\le |t| \\le 10^5$$$).\nBoth strings consist of lowercase English letters only.\nThe sum of $$$|t|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single string: the lexicographically smallest reordering of letters in the string $$$t$$$ that contains $$$s$$$ as a subsequence. If no such string exists, print \"\nImpossible\n\" instead.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, $$$\\mathtt{abc}\\,\\mathtt{dcbe}\\,\\mathtt{ef}$$$ contains $$$\\mathtt{dcbe}$$$.\nIn the second test case, $$$\\mathtt{aaaaa}\\,\\mathtt{baba}\\,\\mathtt{bcc}\\,\\mathtt{dab}$$$ also contains $$$\\mathtt{babadab}$$$.\nIt can be proven that these are the lexicographically smallest strings satisfying the given condition.\nIn the third test case, no rearrangement of letters in $$$t$$$ contains $$$s$$$.",
