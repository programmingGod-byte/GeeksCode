    "title": "B. Unconventional Pairs",
    "statement": "A popular reality show\nUnconventional Pairs\nhas been launched in the city. According to the rules of the show, participants are paired in an unusual way: with an even number of people, all participants must be in pairs.\nPetya has an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots ,a_n$$$. It is known that $$$n$$$ is even. Petya must divide the participants (numbers) into exactly $$$\\large\\frac{n}{2}$$$ pairs $$$(a_{p_1},a_{q_1}),\\,(a_{p_2},a_{q_2}),\\dots\\,(a_{p_\\frac{n}{2}},a_{q_\\frac{n}{2}})$$$. Each index can be included in no more than one pair.\nFor a pair $$$(x,y)$$$, its\ndifference\nis defined as $$$|x-y|$$$. Petya wants to form\nunconventional pairs\nsuch that the\nmaximum\ndifference among all pairs is minimized.\nDetermine the minimum possible value of this maximum difference.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test consists of several test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one even number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\dots ,a_n$$$ $$$(-10^{9} \\le a_i \\le 10^{9})$$$ — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single number — the minimum possible maximum difference between the elements in pairs.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the array is: $$$[1,2]$$$. The only possible (and therefore optimal) pair is $$$(1,2)$$$, its difference is $$$|1-2| = 1$$$, the answer is $$$1$$$.\nIn the second test case, the array is: $$$[10,1,2,9]$$$. We can choose pairs — $$$(1,2)$$$ and $$$(9,10)$$$: both differences are equal to $$$1$$$, therefore, the maximum difference is $$$1$$$.\nIn the third test case, the array is: $$$[3,8,9,3,3,2]$$$. We can choose pairs: $$$(2,3)$$$, $$$(3,3)$$$, $$$(8,9)$$$. The differences are: $$$1,0,1$$$ — the largest is $$$1$$$.",
