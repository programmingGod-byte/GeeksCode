For example, $$$[1, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2]$$$ is balanced, but $$$[2]$$$ and $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$ are not.\nYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements, $$$[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$. The array may not be balanced currently, and you can delete some elements to make it balanced. What is the minimum number of elements you need to delete to make the array balanced?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the minimum number of elements you should remove from the array to make it balanced.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the given array is already balanced.\nIn the second test case, we can delete one occurrence of $$$1$$$ and one occurrence of $$$3$$$ to get the array $$$[1, 2, 2]$$$ which is balanced.",
