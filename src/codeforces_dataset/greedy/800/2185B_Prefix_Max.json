    "title": "B. Prefix Max",
    "statement": "You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$.\nThe value of an array is the sum of the maximums of each prefix of the array. More formally, the value of an array $$$a$$$ is $$$\\sum_{i=1} ^{n} \\operatorname{max}(a_1, \\ldots, a_i)$$$. For example, the value of the array [$$$1, 2, 1$$$] is $$$\\operatorname{max}(1) + \\operatorname{max}(1, 2) + \\operatorname{max}(1, 2, 1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$$$.\nYou can choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ and swap elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$; this operation can be applied\nat most\none time.\nFind the maximum possible value of the array $$$a$$$ after at most one operation.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible value of the array $$$a$$$ after the swap has been performed.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, we can swap $$$a_1$$$ with $$$a_4$$$ to get the array [$$$5, 1, 4, 2, 3$$$], which has a value of $$$\\operatorname{max}(5) + \\operatorname{max}(5, 1) + \\operatorname{max}(5, 1, 4) + \\operatorname{max}(5, 1, 4, 2) + \\operatorname{max}(5, 1, 4, 2, 3) = 25$$$.\nFor the second test case, the current value of the array is $$$\\operatorname{max}(5) + \\operatorname{max}(5, 1) = 10$$$. If we were to swap $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, $$$a$$$ would be equal to [$$$1, 5$$$], which has a value of $$$\\operatorname{max}(1) + \\operatorname{max}(1, 5) = 6$$$, meaning the best option is to not perform a swap.",
