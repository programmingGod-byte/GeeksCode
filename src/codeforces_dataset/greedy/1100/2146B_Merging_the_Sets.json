    "title": "B. Merging the Sets",
    "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ sets $$$S_1,S_2,\\ldots,S_n$$$, where each element in the sets is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$.\nYou want to choose some of the sets (possibly none or all), such that every integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ is included in\nat least one\nof the chosen sets.\nYou have to determine whether there exist\nat least three\nways to choose the sets.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 5\\cdot 10^4$$$, $$$1\\le m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of sets and the upper bound of the integers in the sets.\nThen $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line first containing an integer $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1\\le l_i\\le m$$$) — the size of set $$$S_i$$$.\nThen $$$l_i$$$ integers $$$S_{i,1}, S_{i,2}, \\ldots, S_{i, l_i}$$$ follow in the same line ($$$1\\le S_{i,1} < S_{i,2} < \\cdots < S_{i, l_i}\\le m$$$) — the elements of set $$$S_i$$$.\nLet $$$L=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n l_i$$$. It is guaranteed that:\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^4$$$;\nThe sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$;\nThe sum of $$$L$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print \"\nYES\n\" if there exist at least three ways to choose the sets. Otherwise, print \"\nNO\n\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"\nyEs\n\", \"\nyes\n\", \"\nYes\n\", and \"\nYES\n\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, there are $$$5\\ge 3$$$ possible ways to choose the sets:\n$$$S_1$$$ — both $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are included in $$$S_1$$$;\n$$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$ — $$$1$$$ is included in $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$, and $$$2$$$ is included in $$$S_1$$$;\n$$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_3$$$ — $$$1$$$ is included in $$$S_1$$$, and $$$2$$$ is included in $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_3$$$;\n$$$S_2$$$ and $$$S_3$$$ — $$$1$$$ is included in $$$S_2$$$, and $$$2$$$ is included in $$$S_3$$$;\n$$$S_1$$$, $$$S_2$$$, and $$$S_3$$$ — $$$1$$$ is included in $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$, and $$$2$$$ is included in $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_3$$$.\nNote that it is invalid to choose $$$S_2$$$ only because $$$2$$$ is not included in $$$S_2$$$.\nIn the second test case, the only way is to choose all the sets.\nIn the third test case, $$$5$$$ does not appear in any of the sets, so there is no way to choose the sets.\nIn the fourth test case, choosing any non-empty collection of the sets is valid, so the number of ways is $$$2^5-1=31\\ge3$$$.",
