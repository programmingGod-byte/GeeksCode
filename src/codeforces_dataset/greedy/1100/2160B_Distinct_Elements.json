    "statement": "Given an array $$$c$$$, let $$$f(c)$$$ be the number of distinct elements in $$$c$$$. For example, $$$f([1,2,2])=2$$$ because there are two distinct elements in $$$[1,2,2]$$$: $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. Also, define $$$c[i,j]$$$ as the subarray$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$c$$$ bounded by positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ (that is, the array $$$[c_i,c_{i+1},\\ldots,c_j]$$$).\nThere is an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. An array $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements is constructed such that $$$b_i=f(a[1,i])+f(a[2,i])+\\ldots+f(a[i,i])$$$. You are given the array $$$b$$$. Find any possible $$$a$$$ with elements $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$. It is guaranteed that at least one possible $$$a$$$ exists.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$) – the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^{18}$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print any possible $$$a$$$ on a new line. The array $$$a$$$ should satisfy $$$1\\leq a_i\\leq n$$$.\nFor every test case, it is guaranteed at least one $$$a$$$ that satisfies the conditions exists.",
    "note": "Note\nLet's verify our output for the second test case is correct:\n$$$b_1=f([2])=1$$$\n$$$b_2=f([2,3])+f([3])=2+1=3$$$\n$$$b_3=f([2,3,2])+f([3,2])+f([2])=2+2+1=5$$$",
