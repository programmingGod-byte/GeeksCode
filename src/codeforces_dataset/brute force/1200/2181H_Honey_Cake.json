    "title": "H. Honey Cake",
    "statement": "Hannah and Henry are going to host a party for $$$n$$$ people, including themselves.\nThey bought a honey cake of size $$$w \\times h \\times d$$$ inches for the party, and want to split it into $$$n$$$ equal pieces.\nThe honey cake can be cut parallel to any of its faces. To make cuts precise, each edge of length $$$w$$$ is cut into the same number of equal parts, each having integer length; similarly for edges of lengths $$$h$$$ and $$$d$$$.\nGiven the dimensions of the honey cake, determine whether it is possible to cut it into $$$n$$$ equal pieces, and if so, how.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line of input contains three integers: $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$d$$$, the dimensions of the honey cake in inches ($$$1 \\le w, h, d \\le 10^9$$$).\nThe second line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nOutput three integers $$$w_c$$$, $$$h_c$$$, $$$d_c$$$, the number of cuts to be made along each of the dimensions $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$d$$$, respectively, if it is possible to cut the cake, or a single integer $$$-1$$$ otherwise. Note that making zero cuts along a dimension is allowed, too.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, the cake will be cut into $$$5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 40$$$ pieces of size $$$2 \\times 5 \\times 3$$$ inches.",
