    "statement": "You are given an $$$n \\times n$$$ grid where some cells are colored black, and the rest are white. You may paint some of the white cells black to achieve the following conditions:\nThere is at least one black cell.\nAll black cells must be orthogonally connected, that is, it should be possible to go from any black cell to any other by crossing several vertical or horizontal cell borders while visiting\nonly black\ncells.\nYou can't go directly through the corner of a cell.\nThere are no three consecutive black cells aligned vertically or horizontally.\nYou can't paint black cells white.\nDetermine whether it is possible to paint some white cells black in order to satisfy all the conditions.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the size of the grid.\nThe following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ characters each — the grid description, where each character represents a cell:\n.\n— a white cell;\n#\n— a black cell.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print \"\nYES\n\" if it is possible to paint some white cells black to satisfy all the conditions, and \"\nNO\n\" otherwise.\nYou may print each letter in any case (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the strings \"\nyEs\n\", \"\nyes\n\", \"\nYes\n\", and \"\nYES\n\" will all be recognized as a positive answer.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, there are no black cells, so we must paint one cell black.\nIn the second and third test cases, the grid satisfies all the conditions from the very beginning.\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible solutions is:\n##.\n.##\n..#\nIn the fifth test case, the grid violates the \"\nNo three consecutive black cells should be aligned vertically or horizontally\n\" condition from the very beginning, so there is no solution.\nIn the sixth test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a connected grid without violating the condition about three consecutive black cells.",
