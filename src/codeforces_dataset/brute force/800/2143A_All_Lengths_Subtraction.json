    "title": "A. All Lengths Subtraction",
    "statement": "You are given a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.\nYou must perform exactly one operation for each integer $$$k$$$ from 1 up to $$$n$$$ in that order:\nChoose a subarray$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of $$$p$$$ of length exactly $$$k$$$, and subtract 1 from every element in that subarray.\nAfter completing all $$$n$$$ operations, your goal is to have all elements of the array equal to zero.\nDetermine whether it is possible to achieve this.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains the value $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the permutation.\nThe second line contains $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation itself.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output\nYES\nif it is possible to make all elements of the array $$$p$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ after performing all the operations; otherwise, output\nNO\n.\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"\nyEs\n\", \"\nyes\n\", \"\nYes\n\", and \"\nYES\n\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, we can proceed as follows:\n$$$k = 1$$$: Choose the subarray $$$[3, 3]$$$. The array $$$[1, 3, 4, 2]$$$ becomes $$$[1, 3, 3, 2]$$$.\n$$$k = 2$$$: Choose the subarray $$$[2, 3]$$$. The array $$$[1, 3, 3, 2]$$$ becomes $$$[1, 2, 2, 2]$$$.\n$$$k = 3$$$: Choose the subarray $$$[2, 4]$$$. The array $$$[1, 2, 2, 2]$$$ becomes $$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$.\n$$$k = 4$$$: Choose the subarray $$$[1, 4]$$$. The array $$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ becomes $$$[0, 0, 0, 0]$$$.\nThus, we have successfully reduced the entire array to zeros, so the answer is\nYES\n.\nFor the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to reduce all elements to zero.\nFor the third test case, the process is as follows:\n$$$[2, 4, \\boldsymbol{5}, 3, 1] \\rightarrow [2, \\boldsymbol{4, 4}, 3, 1] \\rightarrow [2, \\boldsymbol{3, 3, 3}, 1] \\rightarrow [\\boldsymbol{2, 2, 2, 2}, 1] \\rightarrow [\\boldsymbol{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}] \\rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].$$$\nThe bolded values indicate the subarrays from which we subtract at each step.\nFor the fourth test case, it can also be proven that it is impossible to make all values zero.",
