    "title": "A. Sequence Game",
    "statement": "Given an integer sequence of length $$$n$$$ denoted as $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$.\nYou can perform the following operation: select two adjacent numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ and replace them with an integer $$$y$$$, which satisfies $$$\\min(a_i,a_{i+1}) \\le y \\le \\max(a_i,a_{i+1})$$$. After the replacement, the original $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ are removed from the sequence, and the elements are renumbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.\nFor example, for $$$a=[1,2,4,5]$$$ you can select $$$a_2=2$$$ and $$$a_3=4$$$, and replace them with $$$3$$$. After that, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1,3,5]$$$. However, you cannot select $$$a_1=1$$$ and $$$a_2=2$$$ and replace them with $$$3$$$ (since $$$y$$$ is bigger than $$$\\max(a_i,a_{i+1})$$$, nor can you select $$$a_1=1$$$ and $$$a_3=4$$$ (the selected numbers should be adjacent).\nClearly, after performing $$$n-1$$$ operations, only one number will remain. The question is whether this final number can be exactly equal to $$$x$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).\nThe third line of each test case contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output \"\nYES\n\" (without quotes) if the final number can be exactly equal to $$$x$$$, and \"\nNO\n\" otherwise.\nYou can output \"\nYES\n\" and \"\nNO\n\" in any case (for example, strings \"\nyES\n\", \"\nyes\n\" and \"\nYes\n\" will be recognized as a positive response).",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, you can first select $$$a_2=7$$$ and $$$a_3=5$$$, and replace them with $$$6$$$. After that, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 6]$$$. Now you can select $$$a_1=2$$$ and $$$a_2=6$$$, and replace them with $$$4$$$.\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that the final number can never be $$$8$$$.",
