    "statement": "We call an array\nbalanced\nif and only if the numbers of occurrences of any of its elements are the same. For example, $$$[1,1,3,3,6,6]$$$ and $$$[2,2,2,2]$$$ are\nbalanced\n, but $$$[1,2,3,3]$$$ is not\nbalanced\n(the numbers of occurrences of elements $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ are different). Note that an empty array is always\nbalanced\n.\nYou are given a non-decreasing array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Find the length of its longest\nbalanced\nsubsequence$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_1\\le a_2\\le \\cdots \\le a_n\\le n$$$) — the elements of $$$a$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest\nbalanced\nsubsequence of $$$a$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the whole array $$$a = [1, 1, 4, 4, 4]$$$ is not\nbalanced\nbecause the number of occurrences of element $$$1$$$ is $$$2$$$, while the number of occurrences of element $$$4$$$ is $$$3$$$, which are not equal. The subsequence $$$[1, 1, 4, 4]$$$ is\nbalanced\nbecause the numbers of occurrences of elements $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ are both $$$2$$$. Thus, the length of the longest\nbalanced\nsubsequence of $$$a$$$ is $$$4$$$.\nIn the second test case, the whole array $$$a = [1, 2]$$$ is already\nbalanced\n, so the length of the longest\nbalanced\nsubsequence of $$$a$$$ is $$$2$$$.\nIn the third test case, the longest\nbalanced\nsubsequence of $$$a$$$ is $$$[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, the whole array $$$a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$$$ is already\nbalanced\n, so the length of the longest\nbalanced\nsubsequence of $$$a$$$ is $$$5$$$.",
