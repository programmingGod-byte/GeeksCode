    "title": "A. Carnival Wheel",
    "statement": "You have a prize wheel divided into $$$l$$$ sections, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$l-1$$$. The sections are arranged in a circle, so after section $$$l-1$$$, the numbering continues again from section $$$0$$$.\nInitially, the prize pointer is at section $$$a$$$. Each time you spin the wheel, the pointer moves exactly $$$b$$$ sections forward. That is, after one spin, the pointer moves from section $$$a$$$ to section $$$(a+b)\\bmod l$$$, after two spins to $$$(a+2b)\\bmod l$$$, and so on$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$.\nYou may spin the wheel any number of times (including zero). After you stop, the section where the pointer finally lands determines your prize: you receive an amount equal to the number of that section.\nWhat is the maximum prize you can obtain?\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$Here, $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$l, a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le l, b \\le 5000$$$, $$$0 \\le a \\le l-1$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the maximum prize that can be obtained.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, by spinning the wheel three times and then claiming the reward, you can obtain a maximum value of $$$4$$$. The sequence of pointer positions is: $$$3, 0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, \\ldots$$$\nIn the second test case, the pointer will remain on section $$$0$$$ indefinitely.\nIn the fourth test case, with $$$b = 1$$$ and starting from section $$$0$$$, the pointer will iterate over all sections, including the last one.\nLink to the visualizer",
