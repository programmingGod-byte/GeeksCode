    "statement": "Aru loves playing card games (Poker, Texas hold 'em, Balatro, etc.) and she has perfected the art of shuffling cards, especially the\nriffle\nshuffle. She is playing with Mutsuki now, and it's her turn to shuffle the cards!\nHowever, Mutsuki knows that Aru is too perfect with her shuffling game. In fact, given a deck with an\neven\nnumber of cards, Aru always performs a perfect riffle: she cuts the deck evenly and interleaves the two halves. Formally, if the deck is represented by a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where $$$s_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th card from the top, one riffle produces the deck $$$$$$s^\\prime = s_1 + s_{n/2 + 1} + s_2 + s_{n/2 + 2} + \\ldots + s_{n/2} + s_{n}.$$$$$$ Mutsuki also knows that when handed a deck of cards, Aru will riffle it exactly $$$t$$$ times.\nMutsuki currently holds a deck of $$$2^k$$$ cards, represented by a string $$$d$$$.\nBefore\ngiving the deck to Aru, Mutsuki can choose to\ncut\nthe deck, by moving some number of cards from the top to the bottom of the deck. Formally, she can choose any $$$m$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$2^k - 1$$$, and produce the deck $$$$$$d^\\prime = d_{m + 1} + d_{m + 2} + \\ldots + d_{2^k} + d_1 + d_2 + \\ldots + d_m.$$$$$$\nAmong all $$$2^k$$$ possible cuts, Mutsuki wants to choose the one that results in the\nlexicographically smallest\ndeck after Aru riffles it $$$t$$$ times. Can you figure this out for her?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$t$$$, representing the size parameter of the deck, and the number of times Aru will riffle the deck, respectively.\nThe second line contains a string $$$d$$$ of $$$2^k$$$ lowercase characters, representing the original deck of cards that Mutsuki has.\n$$$1 \\le k \\le 18$$$\n$$$0 \\le t \\le 10^9$$$",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nPrint a string in one line, representing the lexicographically smallest deck of cards that Mutsuki can produce, by first cutting the deck and letting Aru riffle it $$$t$$$ times.",
