    "statement": "There are $$$n$$$ children standing in a line, where the\nniceness\nof the $$$i$$$-th child is $$$a_i$$$. Santa is deciding which children belong on the nice list and which belong on the naughty list.\nAn integer $$$X$$$ is initially set to $$$0$$$. Santa will perform the following operation\nexactly\n$$$n-1$$$ times:\nChoose the first or second child in line and remove them from the line.\nLet $$$w$$$ be the\nniceness\nof the chosen child.\nIf the first child was chosen, add them to the nice list and add $$$w$$$ to $$$X$$$.\nIf the second child was chosen, add them to the naughty list and subtract $$$w$$$ from $$$X$$$.\nNote that after all operations, exactly one child remains unassigned to a list.\nDetermine the maximum possible value of $$$X$$$ that Santa can obtain after all $$$n-1$$$ operations.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of children.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$) — the\nniceness\nof each child.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible value of $$$X$$$ that Santa can obtain after all $$$n-1$$$ operations.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, Santa will perform exactly one operation. If he chooses the first child, he will add $$$a_1=2$$$ to $$$X$$$ to get $$$X=2$$$; if he chooses the second child, he will subtract $$$a_2=-3$$$ from $$$X$$$ to get $$$X=3$$$. Thus, the answer is $$$3$$$.\nIn the second test case, it is optimal to select the first child in all three operations. The value of $$$X$$$ will be $$$1+4+3=8$$$.\nIn the third test case, below is an optimal sequence of operations:\n#\nType\nNiceness\nof remaining children\n$$$X$$$ after operation\n0\n—\n$$$[-4, 2, 3, -6]$$$\n$$$0$$$\n1\nFirst\n$$$[2, 3, -6]$$$\n$$$-4$$$\n2\nFirst\n$$$[3, -6]$$$\n$$$-2$$$\n3\nSecond\n$$$[3]$$$\n$$$4$$$\nIn the fourth test case, below is an optimal sequence of operations:\n#\nType\nNiceness\nof remaining children\n$$$X$$$ after operation\n0\n—\n$$$[-2, -3, 4, 10, -9]$$$\n$$$0$$$\n1\nSecond\n$$$[-2, 4, 10, -9]$$$\n$$$3$$$\n2\nFirst\n$$$[4, 10, -9]$$$\n$$$1$$$\n3\nFirst\n$$$[10, -9]$$$\n$$$5$$$\n4\nFirst\n$$$[-9]$$$\n$$$15$$$",
