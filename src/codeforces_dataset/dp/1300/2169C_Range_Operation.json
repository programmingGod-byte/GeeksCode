    "statement": "You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.\nYou can perform the following operation: choose a range $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) and replace the value of elements $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$ with $$$(l + r)$$$.\nYour task is to calculate the maximum possible total array sum if you can perform the aforementioned operation at most once.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2n$$$).\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible total array sum if you can perform the aforementioned operation at most once.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, you can perform the operation on the subarray $$$[3, 3]$$$, resulting in the array $$$[2, 5, 6]$$$ and the sum $$$13$$$.\nIn the second example, you don't need to perform any operation.\nIn the third example, you can perform the operation on the subarray $$$[1, 4]$$$, resulting in the array $$$[5, 5, 5, 5]$$$ and the sum $$$20$$$.\nIn the fourth example, you can perform the operation on the subarray $$$[2, 3]$$$, resulting in the array $$$[3, 5, 5, 9, 10]$$$ and the sum $$$32$$$.",
