    "statement": "A string $$$w$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters is called\nsuspicious\nif and only if all of the following conditions hold:\nThe letter $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ appears at least twice, and\nFor every occurrence of the letter $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$, the two nearest occurrences of $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ are the same number of characters away from the $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$.\nAfter watching you finish a string task, your friend Aka has gifted you a string $$$r$$$ consisting only of letters $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$. You can perform the following operation on $$$r$$$:\nChoose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le |r|$$$), and set $$$r_i$$$ to $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$.\nDetermine the minimum number of operations needed to make $$$r$$$\nsuspicious\n. It can be shown that, under the given constraints, it is always possible to transform $$$r$$$ into a\nsuspicious\nstring.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains the string $$$r$$$ ($$$3\\le |r|\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$r_i = \\mathtt{s}$$$ or $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|r|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make $$$r$$$\nsuspicious\n.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the string $$$\\mathtt{sus}$$$ is already\nsuspicious\nbecause $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ appears twice in the string and the two nearest $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ to the only $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$ are both $$$1$$$ character away: $$$\\color{red}{\\mathtt{s}}\\underline{\\mathtt{u}}\\color{red}{\\mathtt{s}}$$$.\nIn the second test case, it is optimal to perform the operation on indices $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$4$$$. After that, the string $$$s$$$ becomes $$$\\texttt{suss}$$$. The string $$$\\mathtt{suss}$$$ is\nsuspicious\nbecause $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ appears $$$3$$$ times in the string and the two nearest $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ to the only $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$ are both $$$1$$$ character away: $$$\\color{red}{\\mathtt{s}}\\underline{\\mathtt{u}}\\color{red}{\\mathtt{s}}\\mathtt{s}$$$.\nIn the third test case, the condition on $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$ is vacuously true because there is no $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$ in the string $$$\\mathtt{sssss}$$$. Thus, the given string is already\nsuspicious\n.\nIn the sixth test case, the initial string $$$\\mathtt{usssssss}$$$ is\nnot\nsuspicious\nbecause the two nearest $$$\\mathtt{s}$$$ to the only $$$\\mathtt{u}$$$ are one and two characters away, respectively: $$$\\underline{\\mathtt{u}}\\color{red}{\\mathtt{ss}}\\mathtt{sssss}$$$.",
