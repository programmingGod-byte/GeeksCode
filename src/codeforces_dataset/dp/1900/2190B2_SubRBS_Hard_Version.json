    "statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to find the sum of scores over all subsequences of $$$s$$$; $$$s$$$ is not necessarily a\nregular bracket sequence\n, and the constraints on $$$n$$$ are lower\n.\nWe say that a bracket sequence $$$a$$$ is\nbetter\nthan a bracket sequence $$$b$$$ if one of the following holds:\n$$$b$$$ is a prefix of $$$a$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; or\nlet $$$i$$$ be the first position (if it exists) where $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$, then $$$\\color{red}{a_i = \\texttt{(}}$$$ and $$$\\color{red}{b_i = \\texttt{)}}$$$.\nFor an arbitrary bracket sequence $$$t$$$, we define its\nscore\nin the following way:\nIf $$$t$$$ is\nnot\na\nregular bracket sequence\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$, the score is $$$0$$$.\nIf there exists a regular bracket subsequence $$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ $$$r$$$ of $$$t$$$ such that $$$r$$$ is\nbetter\nthan $$$t$$$, then the score is equal to the maximum value of $$$|r|$$$ over all such subsequences $$$r$$$.\nOtherwise, the score is $$$0$$$.\nIn other words, the score of $$$t$$$ is the length of the longest regular bracket subsequence of $$$t$$$ which is better than $$$t$$$. If $$$t$$$ is not a regular bracket sequence, or if no regular subsequence better than $$$t$$$ exists, the score is $$$0$$$.\nYou are given a bracket sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the sum of the scores of all non-empty subsequences of $$$s$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A\nregular bracket sequence\nis a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting the characters $$$\\texttt{1}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{+}$$$ between the original characters of the sequence. For example:\nbracket sequences $$$\\texttt{()()}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{(())}$$$ are regular (the resulting expressions are $$$\\texttt{(1)+(1)}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{((1+1)+1)}$$$);\nbracket sequences $$$\\texttt{)(}$$$, $$$\\texttt{(}$$$, and $$$\\texttt{)}$$$ are not.\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 30$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains a sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of characters $$$\\texttt{(}$$$ and $$$\\texttt{)}$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the sum of the scores of all subsequences of $$$s$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, the only non-empty subsequence is $$$g = \\texttt{(}$$$. It is not a\nregular bracket sequence\n, so its score is $$$0$$$, and the total sum is also $$$0$$$.\nIn the second example, consider $$$g = s = \\texttt{()()()}$$$. It is a\nregular bracket sequence\n. We can choose $$$r = \\texttt{(())}$$$, which is a subsequence of $$$g$$$. The first index where $$$r$$$ and $$$g$$$ differ is $$$i = 2$$$. Since $$$r_2 = \\texttt{(}$$$ and $$$g_2 = \\texttt{)}$$$, $$$r$$$ is better than $$$g$$$. Hence, the score of $$$g$$$ is $$$|r| = 4$$$. All the other non-empty subsequences of $$$s$$$ have scores equal to $$$0$$$.",
