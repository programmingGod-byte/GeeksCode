    "title": "B. Wishing Cards",
    "statement": "It is said that writing wishing cards on New Year's Eve can bring good luck. You have written wishing cards and plan to give them to Little A.\nYou have invited $$$n$$$ friends to help you deliver the wishing cards. You plan to give the $$$i$$$-th friend $$$b_i$$$ wishing cards. The friends will visit Little A's house in the order of $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and each will hand over all his $$$b_i$$$ wishing cards to Little A. Little A always remembers the friend who gives her the most wishing cards, so after the $$$j$$$-th friend's visit, she gains happiness equal to the largest number of cards received so far, that is, $$$\\max(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_j)$$$.\nThe $$$i$$$-th friend can carry at most $$$a_i$$$ cards, and the total number of cards cannot exceed $$$k$$$. Your task is to optimally choose values of $$$b_i$$$ so that the total happiness of Little A after $$$n$$$ visits is maximized under these constraints.\nNote that some friends may carry no cards at all, Little A won't get mad.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 360$$$), the number of friends, and the maximum total number of cards.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le k$$$), the maximum number of cards each friend can carry.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1800$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the maximum happiness Little A can get.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the only way to distribute wishing cards is $$$b = [0,0,1]$$$.\nIn the third test case, $$$b = [1,0,4]$$$ is invalid because you only have $$$k = 4$$$ wishing cards.\nIn the fourth test case, one of the optimal ways to distribute wishing cards is to set $$$b = [2,0,5,0,0]$$$, in which Little A will gain $$$2+2+5+5+5=19$$$ happiness.",
