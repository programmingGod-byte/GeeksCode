    "statement": "Biologists have recently discovered an interesting phenomenon in a particular type of organism. Each organism possesses a gene sequence consisting exclusively of two types of genes, represented by the characters\nA\nand\nB\n.\nThese organisms reproduce asexually, meaning that the offspring usually inherit an identical gene sequence. However, due to occasional cloning errors during reproduction, mutations may occur. Biologists have observed that these errors can take the following forms:\nInserting the substring\nAA\nat any position in the gene sequence.\nRemoving the substring\nAA\nfrom any position in the gene sequence; the remaining parts are concatenated without altering their order.\nInserting the substring\nBBB\nat any position in the gene sequence.\nRemoving the substring\nBBB\nfrom any position in the gene sequence; the remaining parts are concatenated without altering their order.\nInserting a special substring $$$s$$$ at any position in the gene sequence.\nRemoving the substring $$$s$$$ from any position in the gene sequence; the remaining parts are concatenated without altering their order.\nThese mutations may occur multiple times during a single cloning event and always happen sequentially, one at a time.\nFor example, suppose $$$s = \\texttt{ABAB}$$$. An organism with gene sequence\nABBABBA\ncould produce an offspring with gene sequence\nA\nthrough the following series of mutations:\nThe biologists possess an organism with a specific gene sequence $$$t$$$. They are also interested in all possible organisms whose gene sequences have length $$$n$$$. Since each position in a gene sequence can be either\nA\nor\nB\n, there are $$$2^n$$$ such organisms in total.\nThe question is: Given strings $$$s$$$, $$$t$$$, and $$$n$$$, how many of these $$$2^n$$$ organisms (that is, all gene sequences of length $$$n$$$) can be produced from the organism with gene sequence $$$t$$$ through a sequence of valid mutation operations as described above?\nSince the answer may be very large, output the result modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$q$$$. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains the string $$$s$$$, representing the special substring.\nThe second line contains the string $$$t$$$, representing the given gene sequence.\nThe third line contains an integer $$$n$$$, representing the interested length of organisms.\n$$$1 \\le q \\le 10$$$\n$$$2 \\le |s| \\le 11$$$\nThe first character in $$$s$$$ is\nA\n.\nThe last character in $$$s$$$ is\nB\n.\nThere are no two consecutive\nA\n's in $$$s$$$.\nThere are no three consecutive\nB\n's in $$$s$$$.\n$$$1 \\le |t| \\le 10^5$$$\n$$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$",
