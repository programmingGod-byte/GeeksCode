    "statement": "There is a strip divided into cells, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. You are controlling a chip that is initially in the cell $$$0$$$.\nThere is a trap in each cell; they are activated according to the following rules:\nat the end of moves $$$1, (1+n), (1+2n), \\dots$$$, traps are activated in cells $$$x$$$ where $$$x \\bmod a_1 = b_1$$$;\nat the end of moves $$$2, (2+n), (2+2n), \\dots$$$, traps are activated in cells $$$x$$$ where $$$x \\bmod a_2 = b_2$$$;\n$$$\\cdots$$$\nat the end of moves $$$n, (n+n), (n+2n), \\dots$$$, traps are activated in cells $$$x$$$ where $$$x \\bmod a_n= b_n$$$.\nIn one turn, you can either move from the current cell to the next or stay in place. Then all the traps for this turn are activated. If the chip is in a cell with an activated trap at the beginning of the turn, the game ends.\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of turns to reach the cell $$$m$$$, or report that it is impossible.\nIf the chip reaches the cell $$$m$$$ and at the end of the same turn, a trap in the cell $$$m$$$ activates, it is not considered a valid way to reach the cell $$$m$$$\n.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 10^{12}$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$2 \\le a_i \\le 10$$$).\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le b_i  \\lt  a_i$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of turns to reach cell $$$m$$$. If it is impossible, print\n-1\n.",
