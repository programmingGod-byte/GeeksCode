    "statement": "This is an interactive problem\n.\nIn this interactive problem, you are given an acyclic, connected, undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. We define a path between two vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ as a sequence of\ndistinct\nvertices $$$p_1, p_2,\\dots p_k$$$ such that $$$p_1 = v$$$, $$$p_k = u$$$, and for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i < k$$$), there exists an edge between vertices $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$.\nThere are hidden vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ (they may coincide). You can make the following queries:\nChoose two vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ ($$$1\\le a, b\\le n$$$). The jury will respond with $$$1$$$ if the path between vertices $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and the path between vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ share at least one common vertex, and will respond with $$$0$$$ otherwise.\nYour task is to find at least one vertex on the path between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in no more than $$$\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor + 1$$$ queries.\nNote that the interactor is\nadaptive\n, which means that the hidden vertices may change depending on your queries, but will not contradict previous queries.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph.\nNext, there are $$$n - 1$$$ lines, each containing two integers $$$v$$$, $$$u$$$ ($$$1\\le v, u\\le n$$$), indicating that vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ are connected by an edge in the graph.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
