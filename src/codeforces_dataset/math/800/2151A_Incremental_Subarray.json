    "statement": "Schtiffles - Marbl\n⠀\nJames is learning numbers, and he is having fun writing them on a huge blackboard, from left to right.\nAt the beginning, James writes the number $$$1$$$.\nRight after, James writes $$$1$$$ again, and then $$$2$$$.\nThen James writes $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$.\n$$$\\ldots$$$\nIn the end, James writes $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$n$$$.\nFor example, for $$$n = 5$$$, the numbers written by James make the array $$$b = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$.\nJames has a list of favorite numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$, and he wants to calculate how many subarrays of the array $$$b$$$ are equal to $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$. $$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$\nJames is already sure that $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$ is a subarray of $$$b$$$, so the answer is at least $$$1$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The subarrays of an array $$$[v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k]$$$ are generated as follows: for each $$$l, r$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq k$$$, the array $$$[v_l, v_{l+1}, \\ldots, v_r]$$$ is a subarray. So there are $$$k(k+1)/2$$$ subarrays in total, and some of them may be equal.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 200$$$) — the maximum number written by James, and the length of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^5$$$) — James' favorite numbers.\nIt is guaranteed that for the given input, the answer is always at least $$$1$$$.\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ over all test cases.",
