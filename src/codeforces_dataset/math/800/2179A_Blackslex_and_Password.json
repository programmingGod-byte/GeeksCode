    "title": "A. Blackslex and Password",
    "statement": "Blackslex is designing a log-in system for Gean Dev and discovered that most users use weak passwords.\nTo resolve this issue, he posed the following conditions, dependent on two variables $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$, for all passwords. Each password is a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ satisfying these properties.\n$$$s$$$ uses only the first $$$k$$$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\nFor every pair of indices $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  j \\le n$$$ such that $$$(j-i)$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$, the letters $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_j$$$ are different.\nFind the smallest integer $$$n$$$ such that no valid string of length $$$n$$$ exists.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le 26$$$, $$$1 \\le x \\le 15$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the minimal $$$n$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, there are no valid strings of length $$$n=3$$$. For $$$n=2$$$, one such valid example is\nab\n. Note that the only pair $$$(i, j)$$$ that $$$(j-i)$$$ is divisible by $$$x=1$$$ and $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  j \\le n$$$ for $$$n=2$$$ is $$$(1, 2)$$$.\nFor the second test case, there are no valid strings of length $$$n=7$$$. For $$$n=6$$$, one such valid example is\naabccb\n. Note that all pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ that $$$(j-i)$$$ is divisible by $$$x=2$$$ and $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  j \\le n$$$ for $$$n=6$$$ include $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 5)$$$, $$$(2, 4)$$$, $$$(2, 6)$$$, $$$(3, 5)$$$, and $$$(4, 6)$$$.\nFor the third test case, there are no valid strings of length $$$n=6$$$. For $$$n=5$$$, one such valid example is\naaaaa\n. Note that there are no pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ that $$$(j-i)$$$ is divisible by $$$x=5$$$ and $$$1 \\le i  \\lt  j \\le n$$$ for $$$n=5$$$.",
