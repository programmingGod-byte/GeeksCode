    "statement": "Let a\npartition\nof a multiset $$$B$$$ be a collection of multisets $$$s_1, s_2,\\ldots, s_k$$$ such that each element appears the same number of times in $$$B$$$ and across all of $$$s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_k$$$.\nFor example, some partitions of $$$\\{1,2,3,3\\}$$$ include $$$\\{1,3\\}+\\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3,3\\}$$$, and $$$\\{2\\}+\\{1,3\\}+\\{3\\}$$$, but not $$$\\{1,2\\}+\\{3\\}$$$.\nA partition is called\nvalid\nif the $$$\\operatorname{mex}$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of all multisets in the partition is the same. The\nscore\nof a valid partition is the $$$\\operatorname{mex}$$$ of any multiset in the partition.\nYou are given a multiset $$$A$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Find the\nminimum\nscore\nover all valid partitions of $$$A$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$c$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 100$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$$$ denoting the elements of $$$A$$$ ($$$0 \\leq A_i \\leq 100$$$).\nIt is\nnot guaranteed\nthat the elements are given in non-decreasing order.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the minimum\nscore\nover all valid partitions.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the minimum score of $$$1$$$ can be obtained by the partition $$$\\{0\\}+\\{0\\}+\\{0\\}$$$. The partition is valid because each multiset has a $$$\\operatorname{mex}$$$ of $$$1$$$, which is consequently the score of the partition.\nIn the second test case, we can use $$$\\{1,2\\}$$$ as the only multiset in the partition, which has $$$\\operatorname{mex} 0$$$.",
