    "title": "H1. Bug Is Feature (Unconditional Version)",
    "statement": "This is the\nunconditional\nversion of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, there is no \"non-decreasing common difference\" condition. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\nNote that neither version is necessarily easier than the other, and they can be solved independently.\nBug and Feature are immersed in a game of Sequence. In this unique version of the Sequence game, a sequence begins with three positive integers $$$a  \\lt  b  \\lt  c \\le x$$$, forming an arithmetic progression (i.e., $$$b-a=c-b$$$). During each turn, a player can selectively increase one of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, or $$$c$$$ by a positive integer. After the move, the numbers must retain their arithmetic progression, possibly with a new order. Moreover, none of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, or $$$c$$$ should exceed $$$x$$$.\nNot content with the conventional Sequence game, Bug and Feature decide to engage in a $$$n$$$ series of Sequence games simultaneously. For the $$$i$$$-th series, they are provided with five numbers $$$a_i  \\lt  b_i  \\lt  c_i \\le l_i \\le r_i$$$. They will play a game with numbers $$$a_i  \\lt  b_i  \\lt  c_i \\le x$$$ for every integer $$$x$$$ in the range $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ (resulting in a total of $$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (r_i - l_i + 1)$$$ games). Taking turns, they play all the games together, with Bug starting first and then Feature. In each turn, a player selects an unfinished game and makes a move in that game. The player who cannot make a move loses.\nNow, the question is: if both players play optimally, who will emerge victorious?",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of series of games that Bug and Feature wish to play.\nEach of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains five integers $$$a_i, b_i, c_i, l_i, r_i$$$ — ($$$1 \\le a_i  \\lt  b_i  \\lt  c_i \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^{18}$$$), representing the specifications of the $$$i$$$-th series of games. $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, and $$$c_i$$$ form an arithmetic progression. $$$(c_i-b_i=b_i-a_i)$$$\nThe sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is at most $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test, output $$$\\mathtt{Bug}$$$ if Bug wins, and $$$\\mathtt{Feature}$$$ if Feature wins.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, there are $$$2$$$ instances of the game, corresponding to each value of $$$x$$$ in the range $$$5$$$ to $$$6$$$. The sequence in each instance is initially $$$1,\\;3,\\;5$$$.\nBug can secure a winning strategy as follows:\nIn the instance with $$$x = 5$$$, Bug changes $$$a$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Consequently, the sequence becomes $$$3,\\;4,\\;5$$$, and it is easy to verify that no further move is possible in this instance.\nNext, Feature must play by changing the value of $$$a$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ in the instance with $$$x = 6$$$.\nThen, Bug responds by changing $$$b$$$ from $$$3$$$ to $$$6$$$ in the instance with $$$x = 6$$$. After this move, the sequence in that instance also becomes fixed, and no further operation can be performed.\nThus, after these moves, both instances reach states where no player can make any additional move, ensuring Bug's victory.",
