    "title": "D. Game on Array",
    "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. Alice and Bob will play a game with this array. They will take alternating turns, with Alice going first.\nAt each turn, the player must choose a value $$$x>0$$$ that appears in $$$a$$$ at least once. Then,\nthe player earns $$$1$$$ point for each value $$$x$$$ in the array,\neach value $$$x$$$ in the array is decreased by $$$1$$$ and becomes $$$x-1$$$.\nNote that the player can choose $$$x$$$ only if it is present in $$$a$$$ at the moment, so each valid move earns a positive amount of points. For example, if the array is $$$[3,8,5,8]$$$ and Alice chooses $$$x=8$$$, the array will become $$$[3,7,5,7]$$$ and Alice will earn $$$2$$$ points.\nThe game ends when no $$$x$$$ can be chosen; that is, when all the elements in the array are zero.\nGiven that both players want to maximize their points and play optimally, calculate the amount of points that each player will end up with.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the size of the array.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{9}$$$) — the elements of the array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^{5}$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output two integers, the amount of points Alice and Bob will get if both play optimally.",
    "note": "Note\nVisualizer link\nIn the first test case, Alice chooses $$$x=1$$$ with her first move. The array becomes $$$[2,0,0]$$$ and she earns $$$2$$$ points. After that, Bob is forced to choose $$$x=2$$$. The array becomes $$$[1,0,0]$$$ and Bob earns $$$1$$$ point. Finally, Alice is forced to choose $$$x=1$$$ and earn one more point. After that, the array is $$$[0,0,0]$$$, so the game ends. In total, Alice finishes with $$$3$$$ points and Bob with $$$1$$$ point.\nIn the third test case, each player will decrement all the elements and earn $$$4$$$ points each move. Alice will earn $$$5 \\cdot 4 = 20$$$ points while Bob will only earn $$$4\\cdot 4 = 16$$$ points.",
