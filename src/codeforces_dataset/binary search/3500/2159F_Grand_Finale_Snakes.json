    "statement": "This is an interactive problem.\nYou are given an integer $$$n$$$ and an $$$n\\times n$$$ grid of numbers $$$G$$$. The grid of numbers contains each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ exactly once.\nLet's define a\nsnake\nof length $$$l$$$ as a deque $$$[(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \\ldots, (x_l,y_l)]$$$, where $$$(x_1,y_1)$$$ is the head of the snake, and $$$(x_l,y_l)$$$ is the tail. At second $$$1$$$, $$$x_1=x_2=\\ldots = x_l=1$$$ and $$$y_i=i$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq l$$$. In other words, the snake is entirely located in the first row, with the head at $$$(1,1)$$$ and the rest of the snake to the right of the head.\nEach subsequent second, the snake moves down or right in the grid. Formally, the tail $$$(x_l,y_l)$$$ is removed, and either $$$(x_1+1,y_1)$$$ or $$$(x_1,y_1+1)$$$ is added as the new head.\nThe first move of the snake is always downwards.\nIt can be shown that the snake will never intersect itself under these restrictions. The snake will move exactly $$$2n-2$$$ times, never moving outside the grid. At second $$$2n-1$$$, the head reaches $$$(n,n)$$$, and the movement stops. It can be shown that the snake moves exactly $$$n-1$$$ times to the right and exactly $$$n-1$$$ times downwards.\nThere are $$$n$$$ hidden snakes, with the $$$i$$$-th snake having length $$$i$$$ for $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, each moving independently according to the rule above. You do not know how the snakes move. Define $$$f(l,T)$$$ as the maximum number that the snake with length $$$l$$$ covers at second $$$T$$$.\nAn example of a snake with length $$$l=3$$$.\nNow, you are also given an integer $$$m$$$. Your task is to find the $$$m$$$ smallest values of $$$f(l,T)$$$, using at most $$$120n+m$$$ queries asking for the value of $$$f(l,T)$$$ for some $$$1 \\leq l \\leq n$$$ and $$$1 \\leq T \\leq 2n-1$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 500, 1 \\leq m \\leq n(2n-1)$$$).\nThe following $$$n$$$ lines contain the grid $$$G$$$. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$G_{i,1}, G_{i,2}, \\ldots, G_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq G_{i,j} \\leq n^2$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that $$$G$$$ contains each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ exactly once.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^4$$$.\nAfter you read the $$$n+1$$$ lines of input, the interaction begins with your first query.",
    "outputSpecification": "",
    "note": "Note\nBelow shows the tiles that the three snakes cover as they move across the grid.\nThe tiles covered by the first snake.\nThe tiles covered by the second snake.\nThe tiles covered by the third snake are shown in the statement above.",
