    "statement": "You are now in a dungeon with $$$n$$$ swords, facing $$$m$$$ monsters.\nThe damage of the $$$i$$$-th sword is $$$a_i$$$, and the life value of the $$$i$$$-th monster is $$$b_i$$$. A sword with damage $$$x$$$ can kill a monster with life value $$$y$$$ if and only if $$$x \\ge y$$$.\nAfter killing the $$$i$$$-th monster with a sword of damage $$$x$$$, this sword disappears. Then, if $$$c_i > 0$$$, you will obtain a new sword with damage $$$\\max(x, c_i)$$$; otherwise, you gain nothing.\nNow you want to know the maximum number of monsters you can kill. Note that you can kill each monster at most once.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n,m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)$$$.\nThe third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9)$$$.\nThe fourth line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_m$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_i \\le 10^9)$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, respectively.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case output one integer — the maximum number of monsters you can kill.",
    "note": "Note\nVisualizer link\nIn the first test case, you can first kill monster #1 using sword #1, and obtain a new sword with damage $$$\\max(2,3)=3$$$. You can then use this sword to kill monster #2.\nIn the second test case, you can't obtain any new swords because all $$$c_i=0$$$, so you can only kill monster #1 and #2 with your two existing swords.",
