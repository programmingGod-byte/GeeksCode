    "statement": "Greta and Alice are the two permanent hosts of the hit comedy show \"QuestExpert\". For this season they invited $$$n$$$ programmers to complete quests, set by Alice. After that they all meet in a studio to review how well they did and complete the final studio quest.\nToday, the studio quest that Alice came up with is as follows: first, all $$$n$$$ participants stand in a circle in order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ counter-clockwise. Then Alice holds some number of rounds. In each round, every participant writes down an integer on a piece of paper. After that, Alice checks the numbers and for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, if the $$$i$$$-th participant's number is strictly larger than the number of the next participant in counter-clockwise order (participant number $$$(i \\bmod n) + 1$$$), then the $$$i$$$-th and the $$$(i \\bmod n) + 1$$$-st participants both receive one point. After all rounds are complete, Alice calculates the total number of points for each participant and reports them to Greta. It turned out that the $$$i$$$-th participant scored $$$a_i$$$ points.\nGreta thinks that math games are boring, and this one took too long. To prove her wrong, Alice decides to cheat a little and instead of telling Greta the real number of rounds, she will tell her the minimum possible number of rounds that could still result in the $$$i$$$-th participant scoring $$$a_i$$$ points for each $$$i$$$.\nHelp Alice determine this number.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$, denoting the number of participants ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, denoting the final scores of the participants ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that those scores were achieved in the described game with at least one round.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output on a separate line the minimum number of rounds that could lead to the given scores.",
