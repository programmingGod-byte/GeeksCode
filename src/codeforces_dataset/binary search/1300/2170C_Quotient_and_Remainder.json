    "statement": "You are given two integer arrays: $$$q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$$$ and $$$r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$$$, as well as an integer $$$k$$$.\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\nChoose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that\n$$$1 \\le y  \\lt  x \\le k$$$;\nthere exists an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$q_i = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{y} \\right\\rfloor$$$ (rounded down);\nthere exists an index $$$j$$$ such that $$$r_j = x \\bmod y$$$.\nRemove $$$q_i$$$ from the array $$$q$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ from the array $$$r$$$. If there are multiple occurrences of $$$q_i$$$ in the array $$$q$$$, only one occurrence is removed; same for $$$r_j$$$ and the array $$$r$$$.\nCalculate the maximum number of operations that you can perform on the given arrays $$$q$$$ and $$$r$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$2 \\le k \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the size of the arrays $$$q$$$ and $$$r$$$ and the upper limit for $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le q_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$q$$$.\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le r_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the array $$$r$$$.\nAdditional constraints on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of operations that you can perform on the given arrays.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, one operation can be performed: you can choose $$$x = 69$$$ and $$$y = 42$$$. Then $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{69}{42} \\right\\rfloor = 1 = q_1$$$ and $$$69 \\bmod 42 = 27 = r_1$$$.\nIn the second test case, it is impossible to perform any operations, as suitable $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ cannot be found.\nIn the third test case, three operations can be performed:\n$$$x = 42$$$, $$$y = 17$$$: $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{17} \\right\\rfloor = 2 = q_3$$$ and $$$42 \\bmod 17 = 8 = r_2$$$;\n$$$x = 41$$$, $$$y = 16$$$: $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{41}{16} \\right\\rfloor = 2 = q_4$$$ and $$$41 \\bmod 16 = 9 = r_1$$$;\n$$$x = 20$$$, $$$y = 12$$$: $$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{20}{12} \\right\\rfloor = 1 = q_5$$$ and $$$20 \\bmod 12 = 8 = r_4$$$;\nAfter these operations, you'll get arrays $$$q = [5, 4]$$$ and $$$r = [9, 100]$$$, and there are no more operations you can perform.",
