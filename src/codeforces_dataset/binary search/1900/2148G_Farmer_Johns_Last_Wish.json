    "statement": "Bessie has found an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ on the floor. There appears to be a handwritten note lying next to the array, seemingly written by Farmer John. The note reads:\nHelp me, dear Bessie! Let $$$f(a)$$$ denote the maximum integer $$$k$$$ in the range $$$[1,n)$$$ such that $$$\\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k)  \\gt  \\gcd(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k+1})$$$, or $$$0$$$ if no such $$$k$$$ exists.\nBessie decides to help FJ. She defines $$$g(a)$$$ to represent the maximum value of $$$f(a)$$$ over all possible reorderings of $$$a$$$.\nBessie decides to not only find $$$g(a)$$$, but also the value of $$$g(p)$$$ for all prefixes $$$p$$$ of $$$a$$$. Output $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$'th of which is $$$g([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i])$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers on a new line: the $$$i$$$'th of which should be $$$g([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i])$$$.",
