    "statement": "For an integer $$$x$$$, we call another integer $$$y$$$\nfriendly\nif the following condition holds:\n$$$y - d(y) = x$$$, where $$$d(y)$$$ is the sum of the digits of $$$y$$$.\nFor a given integer $$$x$$$, determine how many\nfriendly\nnumbers it has.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 10^{9}$$$).",

    "note": "Note\nThe number $$$1$$$ does not have any\nfriendly\nnumbers.\nThe number $$$18$$$ has $$$10$$$\nfriendly\nnumbers: These are all the numbers from $$$20$$$ to $$$29$$$.
