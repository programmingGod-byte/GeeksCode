    "statement": "You have been gifted a new game called \"Elatyh\". In the game, you are given $$$n$$$ swords, each with its own strength. In particular, the sword numbered $$$i$$$ has a strength of $$$a_i$$$. The game consists of $$$n$$$ levels, each of which features a monster.\nYou start at level $$$1$$$ and progress further. To pass level $$$i$$$ and move on to level $$$i + 1$$$, you need to defeat the monster at level $$$i$$$. To defeat the monster at level $$$i$$$, you need to deal it $$$b_i$$$ sword strikes. The swords in the game are very fragile, so they can only deal\none\nstrike before breaking. If you complete level $$$n$$$ or run out of swords, you can finish the game and proceed to score calculation.\nBefore the game, you are allowed to choose the difficulty level. If you choose difficulty $$$x$$$, swords with a strength less than $$$x$$$ will not affect the monsters. The game score in this case is equal to $$$x$$$ multiplied by the number of levels completed. Your task is to choose the game difficulty in such a way as to maximize the game score.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1\\le a_i\\le 10^9)$$$.\nThe third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ $$$(1\\le b_i\\le n)$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum game score.",
    "note": "Note\nConsider the first test case. Optimal difficulty to choose is $$$3$$$. If difficulty is $$$3$$$, you can deal strikes with swords number $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$. With $$$2$$$ swords you can complete $$$1$$$ level, so the game score is $$$3\\cdot 1 = 3$$$.",
