    "title": "E. khba Loves to Sleep!",
    "statement": "khba has $$$n$$$ friends, each standing on a line at position $$$a_i$$$, and each of them is in the range $$$[0, x]$$$.\nThey all want to come to him. One of his friends, Isamatdin, gave him $$$k$$$ teleports. Each friend will walk to the nearest teleport (choosing the shortest distance). Once a friend reaches a teleport, khba and the friend can instantly meet.\nBut khba is so tired that he'll be sleeping while his friends are walking toward him. Now he wants to choose $$$k$$$ teleport positions so that their positions are distinct and lie within the range $$$[0, x]$$$, in order to maximize the time it takes for the first friend who reaches a teleport to reach it. Assume that friends move at the same speed.\nSince khba isn't good at calculations, you should output the $$$k$$$ chosen teleport positions.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, k \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k - 1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$$$) — the number of friends, the number of teleports, and the range of possible positions for the teleports.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq x$$$) — the positions of khba's friends.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single line containing $$$k$$$ integers — the $$$k$$$ chosen teleport positions. The positions must be distinct and lie within the range $$$[0, x]$$$. The positions may be output in any order.\nIf there are multiple optimal choices, output any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nSample 1.\nFriends at positions $$$[1,0,2,4]$$$. Chosen teleport position: $$$[3]$$$.\nNearest teleport for each friend is in $$$3$$$, minimal times for friends are $$$[2, 3, 1, 1]$$$, respectively.\nSample 2.\nFriends at positions $$$[0,1,2,3,4]$$$. Chosen teleport positions: $$$[0,1,2,3,4]$$$.\nMinimal times for friends are $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$, respectively.\nSample 3.\nFriends at positions $$$[4,0]$$$. Chosen teleport position: $$$[2]$$$.\nMinimal times for friends are $$$[2, 2]$$$, respectively.\nSample 4.\nFriends at positions $$$[2,4,3]$$$. Chosen teleport positions: $$$[0,1,5,6]$$$.\nMinimal times for friends are $$$[1, 1, 2]$$$, respectively.\nSample 5.\nFriends at positions $$$[6,12,0]$$$. Chosen teleport positions: $$$[3,9]$$$.\nMinimal times for friends are $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$, respectively.",
