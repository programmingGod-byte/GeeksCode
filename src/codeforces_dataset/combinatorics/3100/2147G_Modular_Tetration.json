    "statement": "For a positive integer $$$a$$$, we define a recurrence $$$\\{b_n\\}_{n\\geq 0}$$$ as $$$b_n = a^{b_{n-1}}$$$, with $$$b_0 = 1$$$.\nWe say that a positive integer $$$a$$$ is $$$m$$$-\ntetrative\nif the sequence $$$b$$$ stabilizes to $$$1$$$ modulo $$$m$$$, that is, there exists $$$N \\ge 0$$$ such that $$$b_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$$$ for all $$$n \\geq N$$$.\nFor a given $$$m$$$, calculate the density of the $$$m$$$-\ntetrative\nintegers. Here, the density of a set $$$S$$$ is the limit $$$$$$\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{|S\\cap [1,2,\\ldots,n]|}{n}.$$$$$$ Informally, it is the \"proportion\" of positive integers that are $$$m$$$-\ntetrative\n.\nIt can be proven (under the constraints of this problem) that the density is well-defined and is always a rational number, whose denominator is not divisible by $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe number $$$m$$$ will be given to you as a product of three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ ($$$1\\leq x,y,z \\leq 10^6$$$, $$$m = xyz \\geq 2$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print the density of $$$m$$$-\ntetrative\nintegers ($$$a$$$ such that its corresponding sequence $$$b_n$$$ converges to $$$1$$$ modulo $$$m$$$), modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\nFormally, let $$$M = 998\\,244\\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x < M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, $$$m = 5$$$. For example, $$$a=1$$$ is $$$5$$$-\ntetrative\nsince $$$b_n = 1$$$ for all $$$n$$$. For $$$a= 8$$$, the sequence $$$b$$$ is $$$[1, 8, 8^8, 8^{(8^8)}, \\ldots]$$$, which is $$$[1, 3, 1, 1, \\ldots]$$$ if we look at it modulo $$$5$$$. It can be proven that the sequence is always $$$1 \\pmod 5$$$ for big enough $$$n$$$, so $$$8$$$ is $$$5$$$-\ntetrative\n. For $$$a=10$$$, the sequence $$$b$$$ is $$$[1, 10, 10^{10}, 10^{(10^{10})}, \\ldots]$$$, which is $$$[1, 0, 0, 0, \\ldots]$$$ if we look at it modulo $$$5$$$. It can be proven that the sequence is always $$$0 \\pmod 5$$$ for big enough $$$n$$$, so $$$10$$$ is not $$$5$$$-\ntetrative\n. The answer for the first test case is $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$.\nIn the second test case, $$$m= 10$$$ and the answer is $$$\\frac{1}{10}$$$.\nIn the third test case, $$$m= 23$$$ and the answer is $$$\\frac{63}{506}$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, $$$m= 200$$$ and the answer is $$$\\frac{1}{200}$$$.\nIn the fifth test case, $$$m= 999$$$ and the answer is $$$\\frac{1}{222}$$$.",
