    "statement": "In Taiwan, many mathematics teachers design board and card games to help students grasp difficult mathematical concepts. Recently, a particular card game has gone viral among elementary and middle school teachers because it effectively helps students understand the concepts of divisors and multiples, while also being highly engaging for both teachers and students.\nThe rules of the game are as follows. The teacher prepares $$$n$$$ distinct cards, labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th card has an integer value $$$a_i$$$ written on it, and the integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ are in a strictly increasing order.\nThere are $$$m$$$ students labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ participating in the game. Before the game begins, each student receives a nonempty subset of the $$$n$$$ cards. No two students share any card, and at least one card remains undealt.\nLet $$$k$$$ denote the number of undealt cards initially. The game consists of $$$k$$$ rounds. In each round, the following steps occur in order:\nThe teacher selects one of the remaining undealt cards uniformly at random and reveals it to all students. Let $$$c$$$ be the integer written on this card.\nEach student simultaneously chooses exactly one card from their own collection.\nThe ownership of the revealed card is determined as follows:\nAmong the values of all cards chosen by the students, consider those that are divisible by $$$c$$$.\nIf there are one or more such values, the student who selected a card with the\nsmallest\ndivisible value wins the revealed card and adds it to their collection.\nIf no chosen cards have value divisible by $$$c$$$, the revealed card is discarded (remains unowned). Discarded cards are not used in subsequent rounds.\nEach student follows the same strategy throughout the game:\nIf the student owns at least one card whose value is divisible by $$$c$$$, they choose the card with the\nsmallest\nvalue.\nOtherwise, they choose the card with the\nsmallest\nvalue among those they own.\nAssuming that all students follow this strategy in every round, determine the expected number of cards that each student will own at the end of the game.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, representing the number of cards and the number of students, respectively.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$, where $$$a_i$$$ is the integer on the $$$i$$$-th card.\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_n$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ describes the ownership of the $$$i$$$-th card before the game begins: it is owned by the $$$b_i$$$-th student if $$$b_i \\ne 0$$$, and is undealt otherwise.\n$$$1 \\leq m < n \\leq 600$$$\n$$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{18}$$$\n$$$0 \\leq b_i \\leq m$$$\n$$$a_i < a_{i + 1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i < n$$$.\nThere is at least one $$$i$$$ such that $$$b_i = j$$$ for $$$j = 0,1,\\ldots,m$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ numbers in a new line, where the $$$i$$$-th number represents the expected number of cards the $$$i$$$-th student will own at the end of the game.\nIt can be proven that each answer can be represented by a rational number $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$ where $$$q$$$ is not a multiple of $$$998244353$$$. Therefore, you are asked to print $$$p \\times q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$ for each number, where $$$q^{-1}$$$ means the multiplicative inverse of $$$q$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
