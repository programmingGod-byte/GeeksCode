    "statement": "A polynomial $$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\ldots + a_nx^n$$$ is called a valid polynomial of degree $$$n$$$ if and only if $$$a_i$$$ is a non-negative integer for all $$$0 \\le i \\le n$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ is not $$$0$$$.\nFor a valid polynomial $$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\ldots + a_nx^n$$$ of degree $$$n$$$, its\ntwin polynomial\n$$$g(x)$$$ is defined as: $$$$$$ g(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n i \\cdot x^{a_i} $$$$$$ For example, for $$$f(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^3$$$, its\ntwin polynomial\nis:\n$$$$$$ g(x) = 0 \\cdot x^{1} + 1 \\cdot x^{2} + 2 \\cdot x^{0} + 3 \\cdot x^{2} = 0+x^2+2+3x^2= 2 + 4x^2 $$$$$$\nA valid polynomial $$$f(x)$$$ of degree $$$n$$$ is called\ncool\nif and only if $$$f(x) = g(x)$$$. In other words, a valid polynomial of degree $$$n$$$ is cool if and only if its twin polynomial equals itself.\nYou are given an incomplete valid polynomial $$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\ldots + a_nx^n$$$ of degree $$$n$$$. Some of $$$a_i$$$ have been determined, while others have not been determined.\nAdditionally\n, it is guaranteed that $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_n$$$\nare not determined\n.\nPlease count the number of\ncool\nvalid polynomials of degree $$$n$$$ that can be found by determining all undetermined $$$a_i$$$'s. Since the answer may be large, you need to output it modulo $$$1\\,000\\,000\\,007$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nFor each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 4 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n+1$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$). Here, $$$a_i=-1$$$ means $$$a_i$$$ has not been determined, while $$$a_i \\neq -1$$$ means $$$a_i$$$ has been determined as its value.\nIt is guaranteed that $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ are always $$$-1$$$ in the input.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",

    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, only $$$f(x) = x$$$ satisfies the condition above.\nIn the second test case, only $$$f(x) = x^2 + 2x$$$ satisfies the condition above.\nIn the third test case, $$$f(x) = 2x^2 + x$$$, $$$f(x) = x^2 + 2x$$$, and $$$f(x) = 2x^2 + 1$$$ satisfy the condition above.",
