    "statement": "You are given two integer arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both of length $$$n$$$.\nYou can choose any subset of indices and swap the elements at those positions (i. e. make a swap($$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$) for each $$$i$$$ in the subset). A subset of indices is considered\ngood\nif, after the swapping, both arrays are sorted in non-descending order.\nYour task is to calculate the number of good subsets. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$).\nThe third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 1000$$$).\nAdditional constraint on the input: there is at least one good subset.",
