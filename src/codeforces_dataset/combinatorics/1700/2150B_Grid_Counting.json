    "statement": "ParagonX9 - HyperioxX\n⠀\nAlice has a grid of size $$$n \\times n$$$. Initially, all cells are colored white. Alice wants to color some cells black satisfying certain properties.\nLet $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_m, y_m)$$$ be the cells colored black. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. The following conditions must be satisfied:\nFor each row $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$), there exists exactly $$$a_k$$$ indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$) such that $$$x_i = k$$$. Less formally, there should be $$$a_k$$$ black cells in row $$$k$$$.\nFor each $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$), there exists exactly one index $$$i$$$ such that $$$\\max(x_i, y_i) = k$$$.\nFor each $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$), there exists exactly one index $$$i$$$ such that $$$\\max(x_i, n + 1 - y_i) = k$$$.\nFor example, when $$$a = [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]$$$, a possible set of black cells is $$$\\{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 4), (1, 5)\\}$$$. This corresponds to the following grid:\n5×5 grid with specified black cells.\nCount the number of possible grids. $$$2$$$ grids are said to be different if there is some cell which is colored black in one of the grids, and white in the other. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers — $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n$$$)\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of valid grids modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the only valid grid is the one in the statement.\nIn the second test case, the only valid grid is described by the set of black cells $$$\\{(1, 1), (1, 2)\\}$$$.\nIn the third test case, there are no valid grids.",
