    "statement": "You are given an undirected unweighted tree $$$T$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices.\nDefine a complete undirected weighted graph $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices, where the weight of the edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in $$$G$$$ is equal to the distance between the two vertices in the original tree.\nFor every possible subset of vertices, consider the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the subgraph of $$$G$$$ induced by that subset of vertices. Compute the sum of the weights of the MST for all possible subsets of vertices.\nAs this number is big, you are only required to output the sum modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$$$), the number of vertices in the tree.\nThe following $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u,v \\leq n$$$), representing an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the tree.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000^2$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nOutput a single integer, the sum of the MST weights for all possible subsets of vertices, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nThe first test case is illustrated below. The subsets with at most one vertex are ommited since they have a weight of $$$0$$$ and therefore do not contribute to the sum.",
