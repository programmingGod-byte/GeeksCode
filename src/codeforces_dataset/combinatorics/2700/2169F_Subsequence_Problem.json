    "statement": "Given three integers $$$n, m, k$$$, as well as $$$k$$$ arrays of integers of lengths $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_k$$$ respectively. We denote the element at position $$$j$$$ in array number $$$i$$$ as $$$a_{i,j}$$$. In each array, all elements are distinct (but may repeat in different arrays).\nWe call an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$k$$$ beautiful if for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, the element $$$b_i$$$ is equal to one of the elements of the array $$$a_i$$$.\nWe call an array $$$c$$$ perfect if every beautiful array $$$b$$$ can be obtained from array $$$c$$$ by deleting several (possibly zero) elements without changing their order. In other words, array $$$c$$$ is perfect if every beautiful array $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of it.\nYour task is to count the number of perfect arrays $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing only integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n, m, k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$5 \\le m \\le 10^8$$$; $$$2 \\le k \\le n$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le 5$$$).\nThe following $$$k$$$ lines contain the $$$i$$$-th line with $$$l_i$$$ distinct integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\dots, a_{i,l_i}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i,j} \\le m$$$).\nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$l_i$$$ does not exceed $$$n$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nPrint one integer — the number of perfect arrays of length $$$n$$$ such that they contain only integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, there are two beautiful arrays: $$$[4, 1, 4]$$$ and $$$[4, 1, 3]$$$. Only two arrays of length $$$4$$$ contain both of these arrays as subsequences: $$$[4, 1, 4, 3]$$$ and $$$[4, 1, 3, 4]$$$.\nIn the second example, there is only one beautiful array: $$$[5, 2]$$$. There are $$$13$$$ arrays of length $$$3$$$ with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$ that contain it as a subsequence.",
