    "statement": "For a tree $$$T$$$ with $$$n \\ge 2$$$ vertices, consider the standard process for generating its\nPrufer sequence\n. We repeatedly perform the following steps until only two vertices remain:\nSelect the leaf with the smallest label;\nRemove it from the tree.\nIt is known that vertex $$$n$$$ is always one of the two remaining vertices. Let $$$v$$$ be the other remaining vertex. We define the\nPrufer vertex\nof $$$T$$$ as $$$P(T) = v$$$.\nYou are given a forest with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Let $$$k$$$ be the number of connected components in this forest, and let their sizes be $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_k$$$. It is known that there are exactly $$$n^{k - 2} \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^k s_i$$$ ways to add edges to the forest so that it becomes a single tree.\nFor each $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le v  \\lt  n$$$), calculate how many of these ways result in a tree $$$T$$$ satisfying $$$P(T) = v$$$.\nSince the answers can be large, print them modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le n - 1$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the forest, respectively.\nThe next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n, u \\neq v$$$), describing an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a forest (that is, the graph is acyclic).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print $$$n - 1$$$ integers on a single line. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be the number of ways to add edges to the forest so that it becomes a tree $$$T$$$ satisfying $$$P(T) = i$$$, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, there are no edges in the forest, and there are $$$3$$$ ways to complete it to a tree. One of them is to add edges $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(1, 3)$$$. There are $$$2$$$ leaves: vertex $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$. Since $$$2$$$ has a smaller label, it gets deleted from the tree, and only two vertices remain: $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$. Therefore, the Prufer vertex of this tree is $$$1$$$.\nIn the third example, the forest is shown below:\nSuppose we add edges $$$(3, 5)$$$ and $$$(3, 1)$$$ to complete it to a tree $$$T$$$. It is going to look like this:\nIt can be shown that $$$P(T) = 1$$$.",
