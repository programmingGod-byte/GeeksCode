    "statement": "A group of $$$n$$$ people decided to decorate the Christmas tree. They have $$$(n+1)$$$ boxes of decorations, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th box contains $$$a_i$$$ decorations.\nWe say that a permutation $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$ (an array of size $$$n$$$ where each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once) is\nfair\nif it is possible to hang all the decorations on the tree using the following process:\nperson $$$p_1$$$ takes a decoration either from box $$$0$$$ or from box $$$p_1$$$, and hangs it on the tree;\nperson $$$p_2$$$ takes a decoration either from box $$$0$$$ or from box $$$p_2$$$, and hangs it on the tree;\nand so on;\nafter person $$$p_n$$$, person $$$p_1$$$ follows, and the process repeats until all the decoration are on the tree.\nDuring this process, there should never be a situation where person $$$i$$$ needs to hang a decoration, but both box $$$0$$$ and box $$$i$$$ are empty. If such a situation cannot be avoided, the permutation is not fair. However, if the people can choose from which box to take a decoration during each step in such a way that this situation does not arise, then the permutation is fair.\nYour task is to calculate the number of fair permutations. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$(n+1)$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of fair permutations, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, the fair permutations are $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.\nLet's take a closer look at the Christmas tree decoration for permutation $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$:\nthe person $$$p_1=1$$$ hangs a decoration from the box $$$1$$$;\nthe person $$$p_2=3$$$ hangs a decoration from the box $$$0$$$;\nthe person $$$p_3=2$$$ hangs a decoration from the box $$$2$$$;\nthe person $$$p_1=1$$$ hangs a decoration from the box $$$1$$$.\nNote that if the person $$$p_1=1$$$ takes the decoration from the box $$$0$$$ during the first step, then the person $$$p_2=3$$$ won't be able to perform the next step (since both boxes $$$0$$$ and $$$3$$$ will be empty). However, since this situation can be avoided, the permutation is fair.",
