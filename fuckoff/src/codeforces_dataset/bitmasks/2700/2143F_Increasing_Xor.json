    "statement": "You have been gifted a magic sequence of integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. However, this is no ordinary sequence — it can modify itself in a specific way!\nAfter observing it carefully, you discovered the rule it follows:\nRepeatedly, two indices $$$1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$$$ are chosen.\nThen, the value at index $$$j$$$ is updated as: $$$a_j \\leftarrow a_j \\oplus a_i$$$.$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$\nBeing afraid of strictly increasing sequences, you start asking yourself questions:\nYou are given $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, and you must determine whether the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ can be transformed into a strictly increasing sequence by applying any number of the described operations only within the range $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, that is,\nonly using indices $$$l \\le i \\le j \\le r$$$\n.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the\nbitwise XOR operation\n.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence and the number of queries.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i < 2^{20}$$$) — the contents of the sequence.\nEach of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$), representing a query. For each query, you must determine whether the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ can be transformed into a strictly increasing sequence using the allowed operations.\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and the total sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each query, output\nYES\nif the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ can be transformed into a strictly increasing sequence using the allowed operations; otherwise, output\nNO\n.\nYou may print each letter of\nYES\nor\nNO\nin any case. For example,\nYES\n,\nyES\n,\nYeS\nwill all be recognized as a positive answer.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case:\nFor the first query, the sequence is $$$[1]$$$, which is increasing, so no changes are needed.\nFor the second query, the sequence is $$$[1, 2]$$$, which is also increasing, no changes required.\nFor the third query the seqeunce is $$$[1, 2, 2]$$$ which is not\nstrictly\nincreasing so we have to make some operations. If we apply $$$i = 1, j = 3$$$ then $$$a_3 \\leftarrow a_3 \\oplus a_1$$$. The sequence becomes $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ which is now strictly increasing. Thus, the answer is positive.\nFor the fourth query the sequence is $$$[1, 2, 2, 1]$$$. We can do the following:\n$$$a_2 \\leftarrow a_2 \\oplus a_2 (i = 2, j = 2)$$$. The seqeuence becomes $$$[1, 0, 2, 1]$$$.\n$$$a_4 \\leftarrow a_4 \\oplus a_3 (i = 3, j = 4)$$$. The sequence becomes $$$[1, 0, 2, 3]$$$.\n$$$a_2 \\leftarrow a_2 \\oplus a_1 (i = 1, j = 2)$$$. The sequence becomes $$$[1, 1, 2, 3]$$$.\n$$$a_1 \\leftarrow a_1 \\oplus a_1 (i = 1, j = 1)$$$. The sequence becomes $$$[0, 1, 2, 3]$$$ which is strictly increasing.\nIn the second test case:\nFor the first query, it is not possible to make the entire sequence strictly increasing.\nFor the second query, the sequence is $$$[1]$$$, which is already strictly increasing, so no changes are needed.\nIn the third query, the sequence is $$$[1, 1]$$$. We can make it strictly increasing by choosing $$$i = j = 2$$$ (referring to the indices in the original sequence) and performing the operation $$$a_2 \\leftarrow a_2 \\oplus a_2$$$. This sets $$$a_2 = 0$$$, resulting in the subarray from index 2 to 3 becoming $$$[0, 1]$$$, which is strictly increasing.\nFor the final query, we can perform the following operations in this order:\n$$$a_6 \\leftarrow a_6 \\oplus a_5$$$\n$$$a_7 \\leftarrow a_7 \\oplus a_5$$$\n$$$a_5 \\leftarrow a_5 \\oplus a_5$$$\nAfter these operations, the subarray from index 5 to 8 becomes $$$[0, 1, 2, 3]$$$, which is strictly increasing.",
