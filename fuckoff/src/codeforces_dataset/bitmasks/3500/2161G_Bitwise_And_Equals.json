    "statement": "There is an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, and there is an integer $$$X$$$.\nYou may perform the following operation zero or more times:\nSelect $$$i$$$, and increase $$$a_i$$$ by one.\nLet $$$a'$$$ be the final state of the array. Your goal is to perform the operation above the smallest number of times such that $$$a'_1 \\,\\&\\, a'_2 \\,\\&\\, \\ldots \\,\\&\\, a'_n = X$$$. $$$\\&$$$ denotes the\nbitwise AND operation\n.\nThere are $$$q$$$ such query integers $$$X$$$: $$$X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_q$$$. Compute the answer for each $$$X = X_i$$$. Note that all queries are processed separately and independently, from the same initial state $$$a$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 200\\,000$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.\nThe second line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ (for each $$$i$$$, $$$0 \\le a_i  \\lt  2^{20}$$$).\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines each contain a single integer $$$X_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le X_i  \\lt  2^{20}$$$).",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each query $$$i$$$ out of $$$q$$$, print the smallest number of operations to get to the array $$$a'$$$ such that $$$a'_1 \\,\\&\\, a'_2 \\,\\&\\, \\ldots \\,\\&\\, a'_n = X_i$$$.\nIt's possible to show, that it's always possible to obtain such array $$$a'$$$ in finite number of operations.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first query, you can increase $$$i = 3$$$ ($$$a_i = 7$$$) and get the array $$$a = [6, 4, 8, 5, 4]$$$, then $$$6 \\,\\&\\, 4 \\,\\&\\, 8 \\,\\&\\, 5 \\,\\&\\, 4 = 0$$$.\nFor the third query, original array already matches condition: $$$6 \\,\\&\\, 4 \\,\\&\\, 7 \\,\\&\\, 5 \\,\\&\\, 4 = 4$$$.",
