    "statement": "You have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ strings $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$$$, each consisting of lowercase English letters, and an empty string $$$s$$$.\nIn the $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) step, you should do one of the following:\nadd $$$a_{i}$$$ to the beginning of $$$s$$$, or\nadd $$$a_{i}$$$ to the end of $$$s$$$.\nFor example, if before the $$$i$$$-th step $$$s = \\mathtt{aba}$$$ and $$$a_{i} = \\mathtt{bba}$$$, after the $$$i$$$-th step, $$$s$$$ will be equal to $$$\\mathtt{ababba}$$$ or $$$\\mathtt{bbaaba}$$$.\nWhat's the lexicographically smallest string $$$s$$$ you can reach after $$$n$$$ steps?\nA string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ of the same length, if and only if the following holds:\nin the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) — size of array $$$a$$$. The next line contains $$$n$$$ strings $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le |a_i| \\le 4000$$$), each consisting of lowercase English letters.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$, and\nthe total length of all strings in the input\n(over all test cases) does not exceed $$$4000$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print the lexicographically minimum string $$$s$$$ you can reach after $$$n$$$ steps.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, one possible way to construct the lexicographically minimum string $$$s$$$ is as follows:\nAfter the first step, $$$s = \\mathtt{amir}$$$ regardless of whether we add it to the beginning or the end, since $$$s$$$ was initially empty.\nIn the second step, we add $$$a_2 = \\mathtt{rima}$$$ to the end of $$$s$$$. Now $$$s = \\mathtt{amirrima}$$$.\nIn the third step, we add $$$a_3 = \\mathtt{amin}$$$ to the beginning of $$$s$$$. Now $$$s = \\mathtt{aminamirrima}$$$.\nIn the last step, we add $$$a_4 = \\mathtt{nima}$$$ to the end of $$$s$$$. Therefore, the final value of $$$s$$$ is $$$\\mathtt{aminamirrimanima}$$$.\nIt can be proven that this resulting string is indeed the lexicographically smallest string obtainable after all steps.",
