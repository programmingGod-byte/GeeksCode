    "statement": "A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ are not permutations.\nYou are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation\nexactly once\n:\nChoose two integers $$$l,$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$).\nReverse the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ in the permutation $$$p$$$.\nYour task is to output the lexicographically maximum permutation that can be obtained by performing this operation. A permutation $$$a$$$ is lexicographically greater than a permutation $$$b$$$ if for the first position $$$i$$$ where they differ, it holds that $$$a_i\\gt b_i$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\\le t\\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the number $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2,...,p_n$$$ $$$(1\\le p_i\\le n)$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output the lexicographically maximum permutation that can be obtained with one operation.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case, the best segment is $$$[1, 4]$$$. After reversing, $$$a = [4, 1, 2, 3]$$$. For the second test case, the best segment is $$$[2, 3]$$$. After reversing, $$$a = [3, 2, 1]$$$.",
