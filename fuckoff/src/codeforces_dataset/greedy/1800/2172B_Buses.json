    "statement": "There is a long straight road of length $$$\\ell$$$ meters, where\nposition $$$p$$$\ndenotes the point on the road that is $$$p$$$ meters away from the starting point. Along this road, there are $$$n$$$ buses moving in the positive direction, each traveling at the\nsame constant speed\nof $$$x$$$ meters per minute. The $$$i$$$-th bus is currently at position $$$s_i$$$ and continues moving until it reaches its designated destination at position $$$t_i$$$. Once a bus reaches its destination, it ceases operation and all passengers must disembark.\nThere are also $$$m$$$ people who wish to reach the end of the road (position $$$\\ell$$$). The current position of the $$$i$$$-th person is $$$p_i$$$, and each person can walk at a speed of\nat most\n$$$y$$$ meters per minute. If a person is at the same position as a bus, they may hop on the bus instantly. While riding a bus, they may hop off at any moment. The time required to board or leave a bus is considered negligible. Buses always move at a constant speed $$$x$$$ and never wait for passengers.\nYour task is to determine the minimum possible time for each person to reach the end of the road.\nFigure 1: An illustration for sample input 1.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains five integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$\\ell$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, representing the number of buses, the number of people, the length of the road, the speed of the buses, and the walking speed of the people, respectively.\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$, representing the starting position and the destination position of the $$$i$$$-th bus.\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains one integer $$$p_i$$$, representing the current position of the $$$i$$$-th person.\n$$$1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\times 10^5$$$\n$$$1 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\times 10^5$$$\n$$$1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 10^9$$$\n$$$1 \\leq y < x \\leq 10^6$$$\n$$$0 \\leq s_i < t_i \\leq \\ell$$$\n$$$0 \\leq p_i \\leq \\ell$$$",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line contains a number which is the minimum time (in minutes) for the $$$i$$$-th person to reach the end of the road.\nYour answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$. Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is considered correct if $$$\\frac{\\left\\vert a - b \\right\\vert}{\\max(1, \\left\\vert b \\right\\vert)} \\leq 10^{-6}$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nExplanation of Sample 1:\nA person initially at position $$$p = 3$$$ can reach the end of the road in $$$6.25$$$ minutes as follows:\nWait for Bus 1 to arrive.\nHop on the bus and ride it until it reaches its destination at position $$$t_1 = 5$$$.\nGet off the bus and walk the remaining distance to position $$$\\ell = 10$$$.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the total time spent is $$$6.25$$$ minutes, which is the minimum possible.",
