    "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, $$$n \\le 300$$$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\nA sequence $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$ is called\ngood\nif there exists a coloring of each index $$$i$$$ in red or blue such that for every pair of indices $$$i < j$$$ with $$$b_i > b_j$$$, the colors assigned to $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are different.\nYou are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Compute the number of good subsequences of the sequence, including the empty subsequence$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 300$$$) — the length of the sequence\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the contents of the sequence.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$300$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of good subsequences modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the subsequences that are\nnot\ngood are $$$[4, 3, 1]$$$, $$$[4, 2, 1]$$$, and $$$[4, 2, 3, 1]$$$. Since there are $$$16$$$ subsequences in total, this means there are $$$16 - 3 = 13$$$ good subsequences.\nIn the third test case, every subsequence is good.",
