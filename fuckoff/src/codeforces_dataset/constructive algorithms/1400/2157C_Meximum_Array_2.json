    "statement": "Ferus Melek - Brute Force\n⠀\nYou are given three positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$q$$$. You are also given $$$q$$$ tuples $$$(c, l, r)$$$, with $$$1 \\leq c \\leq 2$$$ and $$$1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n$$$.\nAn array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is\nmeximum\nif $$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$ for each $$$i$$$ in $$$[1, n]$$$, and for each given tuple $$$(c, l, r)$$$,\nif $$$c = 1$$$, then $$$\\min(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r) = k$$$;\nif $$$c = 2$$$, then $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r) = k$$$.\nNote that the parameter $$$k$$$ is the same for all the conditions.\nFind a\nmeximum\narray $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The input is generated in such a way that a valid array always exists. If there are multiple possible arrays, you can print any one of them.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in the collection $$$a$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 100$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, the result of the $$$\\min$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ calculations described by the tuples, and the number of tuples.\nThen, $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains a tuple $$$(c, l, r)$$$, which gives a constraint to $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$$$ according to the statement.\nIt is guaranteed that there exists a valid array corresponding to the given input.\nNote that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, or $$$q$$$ over all test cases.",

    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, you have to build a meximum array with $$$n = 6$$$, $$$k = 2$$$ and with $$$q = 2$$$ constraints given by tuples.\ntuple $$$(1, 1, 3)$$$: $$$\\min(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$ must be $$$2$$$;\ntuple $$$(2, 2, 6)$$$: $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6)$$$ must be $$$2$$$.\nA possible array that satisfies all these constraints, and has elements $$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$, is $$$[2, 5, 4, 3, 0, 1]$$$.\nIn the second test case, you have to build a meximum array with $$$n = 3$$$, $$$k = 3$$$ and with $$$q = 1$$$ constraint given by a tuple.\ntuple $$$(2, 1, 3)$$$: $$$\\operatorname{MEX}(a_1, a_2, a_3)$$$ must be $$$3$$$.\nA possible array that satisfies this constraint, and has elements $$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$, is $$$[2, 0, 1]$$$.",
