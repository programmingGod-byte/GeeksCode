    "statement": "Kubbi - The Cairn\n⠀\nYou are given an undirected, connected graph $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. The graph does not contain self loops nor multiple edges.\nIn one operation, you do the following, in order:\nchoose a positive integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$);\nchoose an integer $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\le s \\le \\frac{n \\cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$);\nprint $$$s$$$ simple paths of length $$$k-1$$$ ($$$v_{i,1} \\leftrightarrow v_{i,2} \\leftrightarrow \\ldots \\leftrightarrow v_{i,k}$$$);\nfor each $$$i = 1$$$ to $$$s$$$, add an edge $$$(v_{i,1}, v_{i,k})$$$ to the graph.\nNote that an edge added by some operation can only be used by future operations, because the edges are added at the end of printing all simple paths.\nMake $$$G$$$ complete in at most $$$2$$$ operations. Specifically, $$$G$$$ must contain every edge $$$(u, v)$$$ with $$$u < v$$$ exactly once.\nNote:\nYou are provided with the input files for the first $$$10$$$ tests of this problem, along with $$$2$$$ checkers (one in C++, one in Python) to verify your output. The checkers assume you follow the input and output formats of the problem. You can download the zip file from the Contest Materials section.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \\leq n \\leq 200$$$, $$$n - 1\\leq m \\leq n(n-1)/2$$$) — the number of nodes and edges in $$$G$$$, respectively.\nEach of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$, $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$), representing the edge $$$(u_i, v_i)$$$. The graph is connected and does not contain self loops nor multiple edges.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ does not exceed $$$4 \\cdot 10^4$$$ over all testcases.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print the following.\nIn the first line, print the number of operations $$$op$$$ ($$$0 \\le op \\le 2$$$) you want to perform. For each operation:\nin the first line, output the value of $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$) you choose in the operation;\nin the second line, output the number $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\le s \\le \\frac{n \\cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$) of simple paths you want to print;\nin each of the following $$$s$$$ lines, print $$$k$$$ positive integers, representing the path $$$v_{i,1} \\leftrightarrow v_{i,2} \\leftrightarrow \\ldots \\leftrightarrow v_{i,k}$$$.",
