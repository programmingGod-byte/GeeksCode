    "title": "B. Split",
    "statement": "You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ containing $$$2n$$$ integers. Let $$$f(b)$$$ denote the number of distinct elements with an odd number of occurrences in sequence $$$b$$$. You need to split the given array into two disjoint subsequences $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$, each of size $$$n$$$, such that $$$f(p) + f(q)$$$ is maximized. Output the\nmaximum\nvalue.\nA sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2n$$$) — the elements of sequence $$$a$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print one line.\nYou have to print the maximum value of $$$f(p) + f(q)$$$ that can be achieved.",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first test case:\nWe can divide the array such that $$$p = [1, 3]$$$ and $$$q = [2, 4]$$$.\nThis way, $$$f(p) = 2$$$ and $$$f(q) = 2$$$ since both have two distinct elements with odd frequency.\nFor the second test case:\nWe can divide the array such that $$$p = [5, 5, 5]$$$ and $$$q = [5, 5, 5]$$$.\nThis way, $$$f(p) = 1$$$ and $$$f(q) = 1$$$.\nFor the fifth test case:\nWe can divide the array such that $$$p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$$$ and $$$q = [4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 4]$$$.\nThis way, $$$f(p) = 6$$$ and $$$f(q) = 2$$$.",
