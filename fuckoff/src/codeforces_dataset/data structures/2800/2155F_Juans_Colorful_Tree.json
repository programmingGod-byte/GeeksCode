    "title": "F. Juan's Colorful Tree",
    "statement": "Juan has a beautiful tree with $$$n$$$ nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. There are also $$$k$$$ distinct colors numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. Each node $$$u$$$ in the tree has its own set $$$C_u$$$ which contains colors. Let's denote with $$$s$$$ the quantity $$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left| C_i \\right|$$$.\nThere are $$$q$$$ queries where you will be given nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Let $$$P$$$ denote the set of all nodes in the simple path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, inclusive. You are asked to calculate for each query the following quantity: $$$$$$\\left| \\bigcap_{w \\in P} C_w \\right|$$$$$$\nThat is, the cardinality of the intersection of the sets of all the nodes in the path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$. In other words, calculate how many colors appear in every set on the path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$s$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, k, q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le s \\le \\min (nk, 3 \\cdot 10^5)$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree, the number of distinct colors, the sum of the cardinalities of all sets of colors, and the number of queries, respectively.\nThe next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$), indicating that there's an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.\nThe next $$$s$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le v \\le n, 1 \\le x \\le k$$$) indicating that color $$$x$$$ is in $$$C_v$$$. All $$$s$$$ lines are pairwise distinct.\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$), indicating a query between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a line: the answer to all queries in the order they appear in the input, separated by spaces.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, there is a tree of $$$3$$$ nodes with edges $$$(1, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$.
