    "statement": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase letters.\nIn one operation, you can select an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1\\leq i < n$$$ and change $$$s_i$$$ into $$$s_{i+1}$$$.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations needed to make every character the same? It can be proved that this is always possible.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 100$$$) — the length of the string.\nThe following line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase letters.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make every character the same.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, you can change $$$s_2$$$ to $$$s_3$$$ using $$$1$$$ operation to reach the goal.\nIn the third test case, you can change $$$s_3$$$ to $$$s_4$$$ and then change $$$s_2$$$ to $$$s_3$$$, using $$$2$$$ operations in total. It can be proved that the answer is not less than $$$2$$$.",
