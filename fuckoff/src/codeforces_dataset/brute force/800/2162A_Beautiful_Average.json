    "statement": "You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.\nYour task is to find the maximum possible average value of any subarray$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.\nFormally, for any indices $$$l, r$$$ such that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, define the average of the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$ as the sum of elements divided by the number of elements or: $$$$$$\\texttt{avg}(l,r) = \\frac{1}{r-l+1} \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a_i$$$$$$ Output the maximum value of $$$\\texttt{avg}(l,r)$$$ over all choices of $$$l, r$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10$$$) — the elements of the array.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each testcase, output a single integer — the maximum average of any subarray of the given array.\nIt can be shown that the answer is always an integer.",
