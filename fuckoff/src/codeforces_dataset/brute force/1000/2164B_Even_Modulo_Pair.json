    "title": "B. Even Modulo Pair",
    "statement": "You are given a\nstrictly increasing\nsequence of positive integers $$$a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_n$$$. Find two distinct elements $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from the sequence such that $$$x < y$$$ and $$$y \\bmod x$$$ is even, or determine that no such pair exists.\n$$$p \\bmod q$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$p$$$ by $$$q$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_1 < \\ldots < a_n\\le 10^9$$$) — the given sequence.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case:\nIf no such pair exists, output\n-1\n.\nOtherwise, output two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the elements that satisfy the condition.\nIf there are multiple valid pairs, you may output any of them.",
    "note": "Note\nVisualizer link\nIn the first test case, choosing $$$x = 3$$$ and $$$y = 5$$$ yields $$$y \\bmod x = 5 \\bmod 3 = 2$$$, which is even.\nIn the third test case, it is clear that no valid pair exists.",
