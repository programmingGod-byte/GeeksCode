    "statement": "You are given a binary$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.\nYour task is to find any subsequence$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of $$$s$$$ such that:\nThe subsequence $$$p$$$ is\nnon-decreasing\n. That is, each character in $$$p$$$ is not greater than the next one.\nLet $$$x$$$ denote the string obtained by\nremoving all characters of $$$p$$$ from $$$s$$$\n, while preserving the order of the remaining characters. Then $$$x$$$ must be a\npalindrome\n$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$.\nYou only need to output any valid subsequence $$$p$$$ that satisfies both conditions. If no such subsequence exists, output $$$-1$$$.\nNote that an empty string is both non-decreasing and a palindrome.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string consisting of characters '\n0\n' and '\n1\n'.\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A\nsubsequence\nof a string $$$s = s_1s_2\\ldots s_n$$$ is a sequence $$$p = s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\\ldots s_{i_k}$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq n$$$. The characters are selected in order, but not necessarily contiguously. Note that an empty string is a subsequence of any string.\n$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$A string $$$t = t_1t_2\\ldots t_m$$$ is a\npalindrome\nif $$$t_i = t_{m - i + 1}$$$ for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq m$$$. In other words, the string reads the same forward and backward.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 3000$$$) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10$$$) — the length of the string.\nThe second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nIf a solution exists:\nOn the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$) — the length of the subsequence $$$p$$$.\nOn the second line, print $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$$$ ($$$1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$$$) — the indices of the characters in $$$s$$$ that form $$$p$$$ (in order as they appear in $$$s$$$).\nOtherwise, print a single line containing $$$-1$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, we remove an empty string, resulting in $$$x = \\texttt{010}$$$, which is a palindrome.\nIn the second test case, we remove $$$p = \\texttt{01}$$$ (indices $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$), resulting in $$$x = \\texttt{0}$$$, which is a palindrome.\nIn the third test case, we remove $$$p = \\texttt{00111}$$$ (indices $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$), resulting in an empty string, which is trivially a palindrome.\nIn the fourth test case, we remove $$$p = \\texttt{01}$$$ (indices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$), resulting in $$$x = \\texttt{110011}$$$, which is a palindrome.\nIn the fifth test case, we remove $$$p = \\texttt{01}$$$ (indices $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$), resulting in $$$x = \\texttt{1001}$$$, which is a palindrome.",
