    "statement": "Given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of the characters '\na\n' and '\nb\n'.\nIn one operation, you can choose a position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$) and swap the neighboring characters $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$.\nYou need to perform the minimum number of operations to ensure that all characters of one type (either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$) are located strictly together, forming exactly one continuous block.\nCharacters of the other type can be positioned either before or after this block, forming two (possibly empty) blocks.\nExamples of valid final forms:\n'\naaabbbaaa\n' — all '\nb\n's are located together (one block), '\na\n's can be both before and after this block;\n'\nbbbaaaaaabbb\n' — all '\na\n's together, '\nb\n's are at the edges of the string;\n'\naaaaabbbb\n' or '\nbbbbaaaaa\n' — both types of characters form one continuous block each.\nYou need to find the minimum number of described operations required to achieve the specified state.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test consists of several test cases.\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.\nThe second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of the characters '\na\n' and '\nb\n'.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required for all characters of one of the two types to form a single continuous block.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the initial string is '\nabab\n':\nby swapping the neighboring characters at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, we get the string '\naabb\n';\nor by swapping the characters at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, we get the string '\nbaab\n'.\nIn both cases, exactly one operation is performed, after which all letters of one type form a single block, so the minimum number of operations is $$$1$$$.\nIn the fifth input test case, the string consists of a single character '\nb\n'. The single character already forms a continuous block, no swaps are needed, so the minimum number of operations is $$$0$$$.",
