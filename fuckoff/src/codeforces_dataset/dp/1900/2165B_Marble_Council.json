    "statement": "You are given a multiset $$$a$$$, which consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$. You would like to generate a new multiset $$$s$$$ through the following procedure:\nPartition $$$a$$$ into any number of non-empty multisets $$$x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_k$$$, such that each element of $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one of these multisets.\nInitially, $$$s$$$ is empty. From each $$$x_i$$$, choose\none\nof its\nmodes\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ and insert it into $$$s$$$.\nPlease count the number of different multisets $$$s$$$ that can be generated through the procedure, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\nPlease note that the number of different\nmultisets\nis counted, which means that the order of elements does not matter. However, the count of each element does matter, i.e. $$$\\{1,1,2\\},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,1,2,2\\}$$$ are all considered different.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$The mode of a multiset is defined as the element which appears the most; if several elements are tied as the maximum, then all of them are considered modes.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le5000$$$) — the size of multiset $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\le a_i\\le n$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print one line containing a single integer — the number of different multisets you can obtain, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, any non-empty subset of $$$\\{1,2,3\\}$$$ can be achieved, for a total of $$$7$$$ multisets.\nIn the third test case, we can generate $$$4$$$ different multisets:\nPartition the elements into set $$$\\{1,2,2\\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\\{2\\}$$$.\nPartition the elements into sets $$$\\{1,2\\},\\{2\\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\\{2,2\\}$$$.\nPartition the elements into sets $$$\\{1\\},\\{2,2\\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\\{1,2\\}$$$.\nPartition the elements into sets $$$\\{1\\},\\{2\\},\\{2\\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\\{1,2,2\\}$$$.\nIt can be proven that no other multisets are possible.",
