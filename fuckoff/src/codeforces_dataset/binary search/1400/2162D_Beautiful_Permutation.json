    "statement": "This is an interactive problem.\nThere is a\npermutation\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.\nSomeone secretly chose two integers $$$l, r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) and modified the permutation in the following way:\nFor every index $$$i$$$ such that $$$l \\le i \\le r$$$, set $$$p_i := p_i + 1$$$.\nLet $$$a$$$ denote the resulting array obtained by modifying the permutation.\nYou are given an integer $$$n$$$ denoting the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.\nIn one query, you are allowed to choose two integers $$$l, r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$) and ask for the sum of the subarray either of the original permutation $$$p[l \\dots r]$$$ or of the modified array $$$a[l \\dots r]$$$. The answer to such a query will be the corresponding integer sum.\nYour task is to find the pair $$$(l, r)$$$ that was chosen to obtain $$$a$$$ in no more than $$$\\bf{40}$$$ queries.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in any order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation (the number $$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$, but the array contains $$$4$$$).",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^4$$$) — the length of the permutation.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all the test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot10^4$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "",
    "note": "Note\nFor the first testcase, $$$p = [3, 1, 2]$$$ and $$$l = 2$$$, $$$r = 2$$$. Hence, the modified array $$$a$$$ will be equal to $$$[3, 2, 2]$$$.\nSo, querying \"$$$\\texttt{1 1 2}$$$\" gives $$$p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$$$. And querying \"$$$\\texttt{2 1 2}$$$\" gives $$$a_1 + a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5$$$.\nFor the second testcase, $$$p = [2, 1, 3, 4]$$$ and $$$l = 2$$$, $$$r = 4$$$.\nNote that the queries shown in the sample test are only for demonstration purposes, and they may not correspond to any optimal solution.",
