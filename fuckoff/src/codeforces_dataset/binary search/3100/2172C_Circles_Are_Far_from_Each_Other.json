    "statement": "You are given $$$n$$$ circles and two integer parameters $$$k$$$ and $$$\\ell$$$. The $$$i$$$-th circle has radius $$$r_i$$$ and $$$r_i \\ge r_j$$$ holds for every $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$. The task is to draw these $$$n$$$ circles on a 2D plane so that the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied. Before proceeding to the conditions, let us recall that:\nEach circle is uniquely determined by its center $$$O$$$ and radius $$$r$$$.\nA circle of radius $$$r$$$ is defined as the set of all points whose distance from its center $$$O$$$ is\nexactly\n$$$r$$$. All distances considered in this task are Euclidean.\nThe interior region of a circle is defined as the set of all points whose distance from its center $$$O$$$ is\nless than\n$$$r$$$.\nWe say that one circle $$$C$$$\nencloses\nanother circle $$$C^\\prime$$$ if all points of $$$C^\\prime$$$ lie inside the interior region of $$$C$$$.\nYou need to draw these $$$n$$$ circles to satisfy all of the following conditions:\nThe centers of all circles are collinear.\nThe distance between any two centers is at most $$$k$$$.\nNo two circles intersect.\nIf a circle encloses two circles $$$C$$$ and $$$C^\\prime$$$, then either $$$C$$$ encloses $$$C^\\prime$$$ or $$$C^\\prime$$$ encloses $$$C$$$.\nThe first $$$\\ell$$$ circles\nmay or may not\nbe enclosed by other circles, whereas each of the remaining $$$n - \\ell$$$ circles\nmust\nbe enclosed by at least one circle.\nAn arrangement that satisfies all the above conditions is called\nfeasible\n. For a feasible arrangement $$$\\mathcal{A}$$$, define its\nquality\n$$$d(\\mathcal{A})$$$ as the minimum distance between any two points belonging to different circles.\nIf there exists at least one feasible arrangement for the given case, output the maximum possible quality among all feasible arrangements. If no feasible arrangements exist, output $$$0$$$.\nA feasible arrangement for sample input 1.\nAn arrangement that is\nnot feasible\nfor sample input 1.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$k$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$\\ell$$$, representing the maximum distance between centers, the number of circles to be drawn, and the number of circles that may or may not be enclosed by other circles, respectively.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$$$, where $$$r_i$$$ is the radius of the $$$i$$$-th circle.\n$$$1 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$\n$$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$\n$$$1 \\le \\ell \\le \\min\\{n, 200\\}$$$\n$$$1 \\le r_i \\le 10^9$$$\n$$$r_i \\ge r_j$$$ for every $$$1 \\le i < j \\le n$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nIf no feasible arrangements exist, output a single integer $$$0$$$.\nOtherwise, output the maximum possible quality $$$d(\\mathcal{A})$$$ among all feasible arrangements $$$\\mathcal{A}$$$ in the following format:\nIf $$$d(\\mathcal{A})$$$ is an integer, output it as a single integer.\nIf $$$d(\\mathcal{A})$$$ is not an integer, output it in the rational form $$$a/b$$$ such that $$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$, $$$\\gcd(a,b) = 1$$$, and $$$|d(\\mathcal{A}) - a/b|$$$ is minimized. If multiple such forms satisfy the constraints, print any.",
    "note": "Note\nExplanation of Example 1:\nA feasible arrangement is illustrated in the first figure, where each circle and its center are shown in a unique color.\nIn this arrangement, the minimum distance between any two points belonging to different circles is $$$3$$$, and the two points witnessing this distance are marked as red dots. Hence, the quality of this arrangement is $$$3$$$, which is the maximum possible among all feasible arrangements for this case. Note that only circle $$$4$$$ is required to be enclosed within another circle, while the remaining circles may or may not be enclosed.\nThe second figure shows an arrangement that is\nnot feasible\n. In this case, circle $$$1$$$ encloses both circle $$$3$$$ and circle $$$4$$$, but neither of these two circles encloses the other, thereby violating condition $$$4$$$.",
