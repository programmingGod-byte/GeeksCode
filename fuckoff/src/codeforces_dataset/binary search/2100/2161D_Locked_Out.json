(c)\nAn array $$$b$$$ is\ngood\nif there do not exist indices $$$1 \\leq i  \\lt  j \\leq |b|$$$ such that $$$b_j - b_i = 1$$$.\nYou are given an integer. array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Determine the\nminimum number of elements\nthat need to be removed from the given array so that it becomes a good array.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 6 \\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the elements of the array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it a good array.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, the array is good from the very beginning, so nothing needs to be removed from it.\nIn the second test case, the optimal solution is to remove the second and fourth elements of the array, which will result in $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$ array.\nIn the third test case, the array is good from the very beginning.\nIn the fourth test case, the array is good from the very beginning.\nIn the fifth test case, the optimal solution is to remove the fourth element of the array, which will result in $$$1$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$1$$$ array.\nIn the sixth test case, one of the optimal solutions is to remove the first and fourth elements of the array, which will result in $$$2$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$5$$$ array.",
