    "statement": "This is the Easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you can make at most $$$\\max(300, \\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil+2)$$$ queries. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\nThis problem is interactive.\nThere is a permutation$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of the integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ hidden from you. Additionally, you are given $$$q$$$ ranges $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_q, r_q]$$$ where $$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$.\nYou need to discover the maximum $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ among the values of $$$p$$$ in the $$$q$$$ ranges that are given to you in the input. Formally, you must discover the value of $$$\\max _{i=1}^q {\\operatorname{MEX}([p_{l_i}, p_{l_i+1}, \\ldots, p_{r_i}])}$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$. To do this, you may make at most $$$\\max(300, \\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil+2)$$$ queries of the following form:\nChoose\nany\ntwo integers $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and you will receive the value $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([p_{l}, p_{l+1}, \\ldots, p_{r}])$$$.\n$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of the integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ elements where every integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ appears exactly once. For example, the sequence $$$[0, 3, 1, 2]$$$ is a permutation, but the sequence $$$[0, 0, 2, 1]$$$ is not.\n$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$The $$$\\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a sequence is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in that sequence. For example, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([0, 0, 1, 3]) = 2$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([1, 2, 2]) = 0.$$$",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains exactly two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$4 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the permutation and the number of ranges, respectively.\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ do not exceed $$$10^4$$$ and $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$ respectively over all test cases.\nAdditional Constraint:\nit is guaranteed that no range is repeated in the same test case.",
    "outputSpecification": "",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, the hidden permutation is $$$p = [0, 3, 1, 2]$$$ and the ranges are $$$[1, 2], [2, 4], [1, 3]$$$. The third range is optimal, as $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([p_1, p_2, p_3]) = \\operatorname{MEX}([0, 3, 1]) = 2$$$, which is maximum.\nIn our first query, we ask about $$$l = 1, r = 3$$$ and the judge gives us the value $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([p_1, p_2, p_3]) = 2$$$. In the second query, we ask about $$$l = 4, r = 4$$$ and the judge gives us the value $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([p_4]) = 0$$$. Likewise, $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([p_1]) = 1$$$ and $$$\\operatorname{MEX}([p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]) = 4$$$.\nSomehow, we figure out that the answer we are looking for is $$$2$$$.\nIn the second example, $$$p = [3, 5, 0, 1, 4, 2]$$$.\nIn the third example, $$$p = [0, 1, 2, 3]$$$.\nNote that this is just an explanation of the way the interaction works and does not show any strategy to solve the problem.",
