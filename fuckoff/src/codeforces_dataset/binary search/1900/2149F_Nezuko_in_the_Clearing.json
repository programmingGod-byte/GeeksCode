    "statement": "Nezuko suddenly woke up on the number line at point $$$0$$$ and has $$$h$$$ health points. She wants to reach point $$$d$$$. In one turn, she can do\nexactly one\nof two things:\nrest in the shade and increase her current health by $$$1$$$;\nmove from her current position $$$x$$$ to $$$x + 1$$$.\nEach movement decreases Nezuko's health; if the movement is the $$$j$$$-th consecutive movement, her health will decrease by $$$j$$$ points. If as a result of a move Nezuko's health drops to $$$0$$$ or below, she cannot make that move.\nFor example, if Nezuko initially had $$$7$$$ health points and $$$d=4$$$, her moves could look like this:\nMove from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$1$$$ with $$$6$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ and decrease health by $$$2$$$. Now she is at point $$$2$$$ with $$$4$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ and decrease health by $$$3$$$. Now she is at point $$$3$$$ with $$$1$$$ health point.\nRest and restore $$$1$$$ health point. Now she is at point $$$3$$$ with $$$2$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$4$$$ with $$$1$$$ health point.\nFind the minimum number of turns required for her to reach point $$$d$$$.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nEach test consists of several test cases.\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$d$$$ $$$(1\\le h,d \\le 10^9)$$$ — the number of health points and the destination point, respectively.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nFor each test case, output one number — the minimum number of turns required for Nezuko to reach point $$$d$$$.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first test case, $$$h = 3$$$, $$$d = 2$$$ the actions could be as follows:\nMove from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$1$$$ with $$$2$$$ health points.\nRest and restore $$$1$$$ health point. Now she is at point $$$1$$$ with $$$3$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$2$$$ with $$$2$$$ health points.\nIn total, $$$3$$$ turns.\nIn the fourth test case, $$$h = 2$$$, $$$d = 4$$$ the actions could be as follows:\nMove from $$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$1$$$ with $$$1$$$ health point.\nRest and restore $$$1$$$ health point. Now she is at point $$$1$$$ with $$$2$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$2$$$ with $$$1$$$ health point.\nRest and restore $$$1$$$ health point. Now she is at point $$$2$$$ with $$$2$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$3$$$ with $$$1$$$ health point.\nRest and restore $$$1$$$ health point. Now she is at point $$$3$$$ with $$$2$$$ health points.\nMove from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ and decrease health by $$$1$$$. Now she is at point $$$4$$$ with $$$1$$$ health point.\nIn total, $$$7$$$ turns.",
