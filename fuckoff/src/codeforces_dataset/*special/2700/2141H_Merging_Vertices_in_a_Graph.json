    "statement": "You are given an undirected graph, initially containing $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. You can perform the following operation on this graph:\nChoose any two distinct vertices of the graph, remove them, and insert a new vertex that is connected by edges to all vertices that were connected to\nboth\nof the chosen vertices. That is, if the chosen vertices are $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and the new vertex is $$$x$$$, then edges $$$(x, y)$$$ are added to the graph for all such vertices $$$y$$$ that both edges $$$(u, y)$$$ and $$$(v, y)$$$ existed before the operation.\nThis operation can be performed any number of times until there exists a vertex in the graph that is directly connected by edges to all other vertices. As soon as such a vertex appears, the process ends. Additionally, if such a vertex already exists in the graph initially, no operations can be performed.\nYour task is to count the minimum and maximum number of operations that you can perform.",
    "inputSpecification": "Input\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$0 \\le m \\le \\min(\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \\cdot 10^5)$$$).\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i, y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$; $$$x_i \\ne y_i$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th edge. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.",
    "outputSpecification": "Output\nOutput two integers — the minimum and the maximum number of operations.",
    "note": "Note\nIn the first example, the shortest sequence of operations is as follows:\nChoose vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$, then the resulting vertex will be connected to vertices $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, and there are no other vertices in the graph.\nThe longest sequence of operations is as follows:\nChoose vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$. Let the resulting vertex be $$$6$$$; it will not be connected to any of the remaining vertices.\nChoose vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$. Let the resulting vertex be $$$7$$$; it will be connected to vertex $$$3$$$.\nChoose vertices $$$7$$$ and $$$3$$$. Let the resulting vertex be $$$8$$$; it will not be connected to any of the remaining vertices.\nChoose vertices $$$6$$$ and $$$8$$$. Only one vertex will remain in the graph, so it will be connected to all other vertices.\nIn the second example, there is already a vertex in the graph that is connected to all others, so no operations can be performed.\nIn the third example, it will take $$$199999$$$ operations to leave only one vertex in the graph, regardless of the approach.",
